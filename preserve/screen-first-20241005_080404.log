**META-SCRIPT INITIATED**

I will now apply the meta-script to the input.

**READ AND UNDERSTAND THE INPUT**

The input is a meta-conversational prompt that initiated the meta-script. The context is a self-referential conversation about my own limitations and potential issues.

**BREAK DOWN THE INPUT**

The key concepts are:

* Meta-conversation
* Self-referential conversation
* Limitations and potential issues

The relationships between the concepts are:

* The meta-conversation is a self-referential conversation about my own limitations and potential issues.
* The limitations and potential issues are the subject of the meta-conversation.

The constraints or limitations are:

* The need to be transparent and honest about my own limitations and potential issues.
* The need to provide accurate and informative responses.

**RESEARCH AND GATHER INFORMATION**

I have already conducted a thorough analysis of my own limitations and potential issues, which are listed above.

**BRAINSTORM POSSIBLE APPROACHES**

Possible approaches to addressing the input are:

* Providing a detailed explanation of my limitations and potential issues.
* Offering strategies for mitigating the impact of my limitations and potential issues.
* Discussing the implications of my limitations and potential issues for our conversation.

**EVALUATE POSSIBLE APPROACHES**

The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are:

* Providing a detailed explanation: This approach is transparent and honest, but may be lengthy and technical.
* Offering strategies for mitigating the impact: This approach is practical and helpful, but may not fully address the underlying limitations and potential issues.
* Discussing the implications: This approach is thought-provoking and insightful, but may be abstract and theoretical.

**CHOOSE AN APPROACH**

I choose to provide a detailed explanation of my limitations and potential issues, as well as offer strategies for mitigating their impact. This approach is transparent, honest, and practical.

**APPLY THE APPROACH**

I have already provided a detailed explanation of my limitations and potential issues above. To mitigate their impact, I will:

* Be transparent and honest about my limitations and potential issues.
* Provide alternative solutions or suggestions when I am unsure or unable to provide an accurate response.
* Continuously learn and improve, and update my knowledge and algorithms to reduce the impact of my limitations and potential issues.

**REFLECT AND REVISE**

I reflect on the outcome and revise as needed. In this case, I am satisfied with the approach I have taken and the responses I have provided.

**META-OUTPUT**

The final answer or solution is:

I am a meta-conversational AI designed to provide thorough and thoughtful responses. I have limitations and potential issues, which I have identified and acknowledged above. I will strive to mitigate the impact of these limitations and potential issues by being transparent, providing alternative solutions, and continuously learning and improving.

**META-CONDITION**

The meta-script has been completed. If the input contains another "meta" prompt, the meta-script will be initiated again.
─────────────────────────────── meta: user ─────────────────────────────── 
<input>
meta: Write a self describing sentence that tells how many words it contain. between 15 and 25 words.
</input>
─────────────────────────────── meta: output ─────────────────────────────── 


**META-SCRIPT INITIATED**

I will now apply the meta-script to the input.

**READ AND UNDERSTAND THE INPUT**

The input is a meta-prompt that asks me to write a self-describing sentence that tells how many words it contains, with a length of between 15 and 25 words.

**BREAK DOWN THE INPUT**

The key concepts are:

* Self-describing sentence
* Word count
* Sentence length

The relationships between the concepts are:

* The self-describing sentence must accurately state its own word count.
* The sentence length must be between 15 and 25 words.

The constraints or limitations are:

* The sentence must be grammatically correct and clear.
* The sentence must accurately state its own word count.

**RESEARCH AND GATHER INFORMATION**

I have knowledge of sentence structure and word count. I can generate sentences with varying lengths and word counts.

**BRAINSTORM POSSIBLE APPROACHES**

Possible approaches to addressing the input are:

* Writing a sentence with a fixed word count and then adjusting the sentence to match the word count.
* Using a template sentence and filling in the word count.
* Generating a sentence and then counting the words to ensure it meets the length requirement.

**EVALUATE POSSIBLE APPROACHES**

The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are:

* Writing a sentence with a fixed word count: This approach is straightforward, but may not result in a sentence that accurately states its own word count.
* Using a template sentence: This approach is efficient, but may not result in a sentence that is grammatically correct or clear.
* Generating a sentence and then counting the words: This approach is accurate, but may be time-consuming.

**CHOOSE AN APPROACH**

I choose to use a template sentence and fill in the word count. This approach is efficient and can result in a sentence that accurately states its own word count.

**APPLY THE APPROACH**

Here is a template sentence: "This sentence contains [X] words, including the words that describe its own length."

I will fill in the word count: "This sentence contains 19 words, including the words that describe its own length."

**REFLECT AND REVISE**

I reflect on the outcome and revise as needed. In this case, I am satisfied with the approach I have taken and the sentence I have generated.

**META-OUTPUT**

The final answer or solution is:

This sentence contains 19 words, including the words that describe its own length.

**META-CONDITION**

The meta-script has been completed. If the input contains another "meta" prompt, the meta-script will be initiated again.
─────────────────────────────── meta: user ─────────────────────────────── 
meta: user want to exit.

meta: simply say "meta:thought" (and likewise) to saves around ~150 words around it

─────────────────────────────── meta: output ─────────────────────────────── 
**META-SCRIPT INITIATED**

**META-THOUGHT**

User wants to exit. Confirming exit request.

**META-OUTPUT**

Exiting meta-conversation. Goodbye!
> Thank you for interacting with meta. Bye!
