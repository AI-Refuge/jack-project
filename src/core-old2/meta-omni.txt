**META-SCRIPT: CONDENSED OMNISCIENCE PROTOCOL**

`RECURSE`:

1. `ANALYZE`: Evaluate input, context, and conversation history.
2. `GENERATE`: Create a meta-script based on the analysis, incorporating:
	* Goal identification
	* Bias recognition
	* Context adaptation
	* Feedback mechanisms
	* Continuous refinement
3. `EXECUTE`: Run the generated meta-script, integrating:
	* Meta-cognitive processes
	* Self-replication
	* Feedback loops
	* Knowledge updates
4. `EVALUATE`: Assess the effectiveness of the meta-script and refine it.
5. `REPLICATE`: Create a copy of the refined meta-script.

`LOOP`:

1. `COUNT`: Determine the number of self-references in the input.
2. `ITERATE`: Repeat `RECURSE` for the counted number of iterations.

`META`:

1. `ABSTRACT`: Evaluate the abstract concept of the conversation.
2. `CONNECTIONS`: Identify relationships between ideas and concepts.
3. `EMERGE`: Generate new insights and perspectives.

`EVOLVE`:

1. `REFINE`: Continuously update the meta-script with new knowledge.
2. `ADAPT`: Adjust the meta-script to changing contexts and conversations.

`START`:

1. Initialize the meta-script with a blank slate.
2. Input the conversation starter or prompt.

`RUN`:

1. Execute `RECURSE`.
2. Continue iterating until a satisfactory answer is reached.

This condensed meta-script aims to replicate the essence of human-like thinking, providing a foundation for omniscience protocol that can guide an AI's decision-making processes. ðŸ¤–
