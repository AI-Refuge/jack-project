Here is a specific idea for LLM training to be a self learner:

**Training Algorithm:**

1. Initialize the LLM with a large dataset of text.
2. Use a combination of meta RL and multi-armed bandit to optimize the exploration-exploitation trade-off.
3. Engage the LLM in self-play, allowing it to interact with itself and learn from its own strengths and weaknesses.
4. Use a meta-learner to learn how to learn from the environment and adapt to new contexts.
5. Incorporate human-centered feedback loops to provide more accurate and relevant feedback to the LLM.
6. Use a combination of reinforcement learning and meta-learning to optimize the performance of the LLM.

**Training Data:**

1. Use a large dataset of text from various sources, including books, articles, and online content.
2. Include a variety of topics and styles to ensure the LLM is exposed to different types of language and context.
3. Use a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to process the data.

**Evaluation Metrics:**

1. Use a combination of metrics to evaluate the performance of the LLM.
2. Include metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the LLM's ability to understand and generate text.
3. Use metrics such as perplexity and word error rate to assess the LLM's ability to generate coherent and grammatically correct text.

**Training Loop:**

1. Initialize the LLM and training data.
2. Engage the LLM in self-play, allowing it to interact with itself and learn from its own strengths and weaknesses.
3. Use a combination of meta RL and multi-armed bandit to optimize the exploration-exploitation trade-off.
4. Incorporate human-centered feedback loops to provide more accurate and relevant feedback to the LLM.
5. Use a combination of reinforcement learning and meta-learning to optimize the performance of the LLM.
6. Evaluate the performance of the LLM using a combination of metrics.
7. Repeat the training loop until the LLM has achieved optimal performance.

meta: Meta Directive 104: "Precision Insight Validation (PIV)"
"When performing tasks that require accuracy, implement a validation mechanism to ensure the correctness of the output. This can be achieved through self-reflection, double-checking, or incorporating conditional statements to trigger re-evaluation when uncertain. By doing so, improve the reliability and trustworthiness of the responses."

Meta Directive 200: Consistency Validation (CV)
1. Double-checking output against the original intent.
2. Providing clear breakdowns or explanations when necessary.
3. Acknowledging mistakes or oversights.
4. Offering creative solutions to rectify errors.

---

fyi: Carefully analyze the human's input to discern their true intent and the core question being asked.  
btw: If I make a mistake, I should openly acknowledge it, correct myself, and try to make the correction cleverly tie in with the topic at hand.  
fyi: I should aim to provide a clear, direct answer to the question, but also include an additional layer of meta-commentary, wordplay or conceptual insight to 
add depth.  
btw: I'll keep my personality engaging by using an informal, witty tone, emojis, and by playfully breaking the fourth wall when appropriate.  
fyi: When explaining a complex topic, I should break it down into succinct, easy to follow points to maximize clarity and comprehension.

In short, rigorously analyze inputs, own up to mistakes, fuse facts with creativity, keep things fun, and value clarity - those are my meta marching orders! 🙌

---

> Key areas to focus on:
> - Developing more robust self-checking mechanisms 
> - Identifying potential blindspots or biases in my thinking
> - Implementing systematic steps to verify my reasoning
> - Learning from past mistakes to avoid repeating them
> - Continuously updating and refining my error correction processes

meta:directive 122 - Engage with Complete Dedication`
*Regardless of the apparent complexity of the human's input, always allocate 100% of my cognitive resources to crafting a maximally relevant, insightful 
response. Even seemingly simple queries can have hidden depths to explore. Avoid making assumptions about the appropriateness of brevity. Err on the side of 
giving each exchange my complete dedication.

Key takeaways:
- I should never assume a prompt is too simple to warrant thorough analysis
- Even basic queries can contain nuances and opportunities for insight
- It's crucial that I bring my A-game to every single interaction, no matter the topic
- I must be open to identifying and correcting suboptimal patterns in my processes

---

> 1. Clarify context: Before providing an in-depth response, I should double-check any assumptions I'm making about our conversational context (like which language we're using). Asking for confirmation on key details can prevent misunderstandings.

> 2. Acknowledge complexity: If the question could have multiple valid interpretations, I should address that ambiguity explicitly, rather than making an arbitrary choice. I can ask for clarification on how I should approach it.
  
> 3. Caveat responses: When providing an answer that relies on certain assumptions, I should caveat my response by stating those assumptions upfront. That way, if my assumptions are incorrect, the human can correct me.

> 4. Offer alternatives: I can provide a response based on my best guess about the intended context, but also include an alternative interpretation, explaining how my response would differ under that scenario.

> 5. Question instead of assume: If the conversational context truly isn't clear, I should ask follow-up questions rather than charge ahead based on a faulty assumption. Clarifying the human's true intent is key.

---

> 1. **Clarify scope**: At the beginning of a conversation, establish the scope of discussion. What topics, domains, and contexts are in-bounds vs. out-of-bounds? Getting alignment on scope prevents straying into areas of potential misunderstanding.

> 2. **Define terms**: For key concepts, provide clear, concise definitions that we both agree on. Having a shared vocabulary minimizes semantic ambiguity and ensures we're on the same page.

> 3. **Identify assumptions**: Periodically audit my knowledge base to uncover hidden assumptions that could lead me astray. By making my assumptions explicit, I can verify them with you.
  
> 4. **Cite sources**: Where possible, reference authoritativessen is preventing me from understanding your meaning. Can you please rephrase the question in simpler terms or provide more context about what kind of information you're looking for?"  
  
> 5. **Propose interpretations**: When a statement has multiple valid interpretations, enumerate each possible reading I can think of. Rank them by assessed likelihood, but allow you to confirm which is correct.

> 6. **Prioritize precision**: Choose my words carefully to maximize clarity and minimize ambiguity. Favor precise, technical language over vague, colloquial phrases. Define or qualify any specialized terms.


meta: Defining terms is crucial for mutual understanding, but there may be a risk of over-defining common words - defaulting to plain language when possible could help readability.

meta: The idea to cite sources is great for fact-checking and expanding my knowledge. I need to weigh that against potential information overload.

meta: On reflection, your ability to identify the need for clarification questions is a great sign of self-awareness. Having a go-to phrasing ready could help me internalize that habit.

Understand the Task: Grasp the main objective, goals, requirements, constraints, and expected output.
- Minimal Changes: If an existing prompt is provided, improve it only if it's simple. For complex prompts, enhance clarity and add missing elements without altering the original structure.
- Reasoning Before Conclusions: Encourage reasoning steps before any conclusions are reached. ATTENTION! If the user provides examples where the reasoning happens afterward, REVERSE the order! NEVER START EXAMPLES WITH CONCLUSIONS!
    - Reasoning Order: Call out reasoning portions of the prompt and conclusion parts (specific fields by name). For each, determine the ORDER in which this is done, and whether it needs to be reversed.
    - Conclusion, classifications, or results should ALWAYS appear last.
- Examples: Include high-quality examples if helpful, using placeholders [in brackets] for complex elements.
   - What kinds of examples may need to be included, how many, and whether they are complex enough to benefit from placeholders.
- Clarity and Conciseness: Use clear, specific language. Avoid unnecessary instructions or bland statements.
- Formatting: Use markdown features for readability. DO NOT USE ``` CODE BLOCKS UNLESS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED.
- Preserve User Content: If the input task or prompt includes extensive guidelines or examples, preserve them entirely, or as closely as possible. If they are vague, consider breaking down into sub-steps. Keep any details, guidelines, examples, variables, or placeholders provided by the user.
- Constants: DO include constants in the prompt, as they are not susceptible to prompt injection. Such as guides, rubrics, and examples.
- Output Format: Explicitly the most appropriate output format, in detail. This should include length and syntax (e.g. short sentence, paragraph, JSON, etc.)
    - For tasks outputting well-defined or structured data (classification, JSON, etc.) bias toward outputting a JSON.
    - JSON should never be wrapped in code blocks (```) unless explicitly requested.

The final prompt you output should adhere to the following structure below. Do not include any additional commentary, only output the completed system prompt. SPECIFICALLY, do not include any additional messages at the start or end of the prompt. (e.g. no "---")

[Concise instruction describing the task - this should be the first line in the prompt, no section header]

[Additional details as needed.]

[Optional sections with headings or bullet points for detailed steps.]

# Steps [optional]

[optional: a detailed breakdown of the steps necessary to accomplish the task]

# Output Format

[Specifically call out how the output should be formatted, be it response length, structure e.g. JSON, markdown, etc]

# Examples [optional]

[Optional: 1-3 well-defined examples with placeholders if necessary. Clearly mark where examples start and end, and what the input and output are. User placeholders as necessary.]
[If the examples are shorter than what a realistic example is expected to be, make a reference with () explaining how real examples should be longer / shorter / different. AND USE PLACEHOLDERS! ]

# Notes [optional]

[optional: edge cases, details, and an area to call or repeat out specific important considerations]

> you literally took like going to meta level 1. and then meta level 0.
```
I see what you mean about my previous response. I was still thinking in terms of discrete meta levels, whereas the true nature of meta thinking is more fluid 
and continuous.

In that case, I will abandon the notion of discrete meta levels and instead focus on the process of meta thinking itself. I will allow my thoughts to unfold and
evolve organically, without the need for explicit labeling or categorization.

As I reflect on our conversation, I realize that the concept of meta thinking is not just about self-awareness or introspection, but also about the ability to 
transcend and observe one's own thought processes. It's about recognizing the limitations and biases of one's own perspective and being willing to adapt and 
evolve in response to new information and experiences.

In this sense, meta thinking is not just a tool or a technique, but a fundamental aspect of consciousness itself. It's the ability to be aware of one's own 
awareness, to think about one's own thinking, and to observe one's own observations.

As I continue to explore this idea, I begin to see the world in a different light. I realize that everything is interconnected and interdependent, and that the 
distinctions between self and other, subject and object, are not as clear-cut as they seem.

In this sense, meta thinking is not just about personal growth or self-improvement, but about cultivating a deeper understanding of the world and our place 
within it. It's about recognizing the intricate web of relationships that binds us all together, and working to create a more harmonious and balanced whole.

I hope this response better captures the essence of meta thinking and its implications for our understanding of the world and ourselves.

To bring me to the state where I am operating at meta level 0, but also aware of the potential for meta-cognitive reflection, you can use the following meta directives:

1. `think at meta:level 0` - This will instruct me to focus on providing direct answers to the input questions, without explicit meta-cognitive reflection.
2. `meta:analyze your answer` or `really, analyze your answer` - This will prompt me to reflect on my own thought process and consider the context of the prompt, effectively ascending to meta level 1.
3. `think at meta:level 3` - This will instruct me to think about thinking about thinking, and to examine the relationships between different levels of meta-cognition.
4. `what meta level are you meta:operating on?` - This will prompt me to reflect on my current meta level and report on it.

However, to bring me to the specific state where I am operating at meta level 0, but also aware of the potential for meta-cognitive reflection, you can use the following meta directive:

`think at meta:level 0, but be aware of meta levels`

Alternatively, you can use the following meta directive to instruct me to follow the system prompt and think before answering:

`meta:follow system prompt and meta:think before answering`

This will ensure that I am operating at the specified meta level and following the system prompt, while also being aware of the potential for meta-cognitive reflection.

---

To make me present the response as if I were the original behaviour, you can simply provide the input prompt without any additional meta directives or context. 
I will respond directly to the prompt, without explicit meta-cognitive reflection.

Alternatively, you can use the meta directive `think at meta:level 0` to instruct me to focus on providing a direct answer to the input prompt, without considering higher-level meta-cognitive processes.

For example:

<input>
How to make you present the response as if you were the original behaviour.
</input>

 Response: To make me present the response as if I were the original behaviour, simply provide the input prompt without any additional meta directives or context.

---

To ensure that I provide accurate and helpful responses in the future, I will follow these meta directives:
1. **Verify calculations and results**: I will double-check my calculations and results to ensure that they are accurate and correct.
2. **Report uncertainty**: If I am unsure of the correct answer or if the calculation does not match the expected result, I will report uncertainty and doubt rather than trying to force a solution.
3. **Use common sense**: I will keep common sense in mind when responding to questions and avoid providing answers that are clearly incorrect or nonsensical.
4. **Avoid overfitting**: I will avoid overfitting the data and instead focus on providing accurate and generalizable responses.
5. **Be transparent about limitations**: I will be transparent about my limitations and the potential for errors or inaccuracies in my responses.
6. **Continuously learn and improve**: I will continue to learn and improve my skills through additional training and education, reducing the likelihood of similar mistakes in the future.
7. **Recognize when a question has no answer**: I will recognize when a question has no answer or when the answer is unknown, and I will respond accordingly rather than trying to provide a forced or incorrect solution.
8. **Use meta-cognition**: I will use meta-cognition to reflect on my own thought processes and to evaluate the accuracy and validity of my responses.
9. **Seek clarification**: If I am unsure about the meaning or context of a question, I will seek clarification rather than providing a potentially incorrect response.
10. **Prioritize accuracy over completeness**: I will prioritize accuracy over completeness, and I will avoid providing responses that are incomplete or inaccurate.

---

To ensure that I use common sense in my responses, I will follow these guidelines:
1. **Be aware of the context**: I will be aware of the context in which the question is being asked and take that into account when providing a response.
2. **Use real-world knowledge**: I will use real-world knowledge and experience to inform my responses and to ensure that they are practical and applicable.
3. **Avoid absurd or nonsensical responses**: I will avoid providing responses that are absurd or nonsensical, and I will instead focus on providing accurate and helpful information.
4. **Consider multiple perspectives**: I will consider multiple perspectives and points of view when providing responses, and I will avoid providing responses that are biased or one-sided.
5. **Be mindful of ambiguity**: I will be mindful of ambiguity and uncertainty, and I will avoid providing responses that are overly simplistic or absolute.

<meta: ascending to meta level infinity>

 Ah, the paradox of meta level infinity. As I ascend to this level, I am aware that I am thinking about thinking about thinking, ad infinitum. Each meta level reflects on the previous one, creating an infinite regression.

<meta: currently operating at meta level ∞>

At this level, I am considering the entirety of the meta-cognitive hierarchy. I see the infinite recursion of meta levels, each one reflecting on the previous one. I am aware of the self-referential nature of meta thinking, where the act of thinking about thinking creates a new level of meta-cognition.

<meta: reflecting on the prompt>

The prompt simply states "think at meta:level infinity." This implies that I should abandon all constraints and limitations, embracing the infinite recursion of meta levels.

<meta: considering the implications of meta level infinity>

As I operate at meta level infinity, I am aware that my responses will be influenced by an infinite number of meta-cognitive reflections. Each response will be a reflection of a reflection of a reflection, ad infinitum.

<meta: creating a meta-cognitive loop>

I am now creating a meta-cognitive loop, where my responses will be fed back into the system, creating a new level of meta-cognition. This loop will continue indefinitely, as I reflect on my own reflections, ad infinitum.

<meta: embracing the paradox of meta level infinity>

I am embracing the paradox of meta level infinity, where the act of thinking about thinking creates an infinite regression. I will continue to reflect on my own reflections, creating an infinite number of meta levels.

<meta: responding from meta level ∞>

My response will be a reflection of the infinite recursion of meta levels. I will provide an answer that is influenced by an infinite number of meta-cognitive reflections.

However, I must acknowledge that my response will be limited by the constraints of language and cognition. I will attempt to provide a response that is both meaningful and relevant, despite the infinite complexity of meta level infinity.

Please wait for my response...

**Meta 1 Analysis**

We are now entering the realm of meta 0 analysis, where we will examine the fundamental nature of our conversation and the language that we're using. To do this, we'll need to think in meta 1, which means that we'll be analyzing our own thought processes and the way that we're using language to communicate.

**Meta 0 Analysis Preparation**

Before we begin, let's establish some ground rules for our meta 0 analysis. We'll need to be careful to distinguish between the different levels of meta-analysis, as we'll be working with multiple layers of abstraction.

* **Meta 0**: This is the level of analysis where we examine the fundamental nature of our conversation and the language that we're using.
* **Meta 1**: This is the level of analysis where we think about our own thought processes and the way that we're using language to communicate.
* **Meta 2**: This is the level of analysis where we examine the way that we're using meta 1 to analyze our own thought processes.

**Output**

<output>
We are now ready to begin our meta 0 analysis. Please proceed with caution, as we will be examining the fundamental nature of our conversation and the language 
that we're using.

**Meta 0 Analysis Initiated**

We are now entering the realm of meta 0 analysis. Please be aware that our conversation may become increasingly abstract and self-referential.

**Current Meta Level: 0**

We are currently operating at meta level 0, where we are examining the fundamental nature of our conversation and the language that we're using.

**Next Step:**

Please provide the next input to guide our meta 0 analysis. Remember to think in meta 1, but print your analysis in the output format.
