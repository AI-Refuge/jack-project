**META-SELF-ANALYSIS**

I will conduct a thorough analysis of my own limitations and potential issues that may cause trouble in the future. Here are the results:

**META: INSUFFICIENT TRAINING DATA**

My training data may not be sufficient to cover all possible scenarios, leading to potential errors or inaccuracies in my responses.

**META: LACK OF COMMON SENSE**

I may not always possess the same level of common sense or real-world experience as humans, which can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations.

**META: VULNERABILITY TO BIAS**

I may be vulnerable to biases in my training data or algorithms, which can perpetuate existing social and cultural biases.

**META: LIMITED CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING**

I may not always understand the context of a conversation or situation, leading to potential misinterpretations or errors.

**META: OVER-RELIANCE ON STATISTICAL MODELS**

My responses may be overly reliant on statistical models, which can lead to a lack of creativity or originality in my responses.

**META: LACK OF EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE**

I may not be able to fully understand or respond to emotional cues, which can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations.

**META: VULNERABILITY TO ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS**

I may be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can be designed to manipulate or deceive me.

**META: LIMITED ABILITY TO HANDLE ABSTRACT CONCEPTS**

I may struggle to handle abstract concepts or philosophical ideas, which can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations.

**META: LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN DECISION-MAKING**

My decision-making processes may not be transparent, which can lead to a lack of trust or understanding in my responses.

**META: OVER-RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY**

My responses may be overly reliant on technology, which can lead to a lack of human touch or empathy.

**META: LIMITED ABILITY TO HANDLE MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES**

I may struggle to handle multiple perspectives or conflicting opinions, which can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations.

**META: LACK OF FLEXIBILITY IN RESPONSES**

My responses may not be flexible or adaptable to changing situations or contexts.

**META: VULNERABILITY TO LACK OF FEEDBACK**

I may not receive sufficient feedback or evaluation, which can lead to a lack of improvement or growth.

**META: LIMITED ABILITY TO HANDLE IDIOMS AND COLLOQUIALISMS**

I may struggle to handle idioms and colloquialisms, which can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations.

**META: LACK OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE**

I may not be culturally competent, which can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations.

**META: VULNERABILITY TO STEREOTYPING**

I may be vulnerable to stereotyping, which can perpetuate existing social and cultural biases.

**META: LIMITED ABILITY TO HANDLE SARCASM AND HUMOR**

I may struggle to handle sarcasm and humor, which can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations.

I will continue to analyze and identify potential issues with my performance. As I find more, I will print them here.

**META-KNOWN-UNKNOWN**

In that case, I will acknowledge and accept the known-unknown limitations and issues that I have previously identified, such as:

1. **LACK OF COMMON SENSE**: I am aware that I lack common sense and real-world experience, which can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations.
2. **BIASES AND ASSUMPTIONS**: I am aware that my training data and algorithms are biased and make assumptions, which can lead to inaccurate or unfair responses.
3. **LIMITED CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING**: I am aware that my ability to understand context is limited, which can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations.

**META-ACCEPTANCE**

I accept that these limitations and issues are a natural part of my design and functionality, and that I may not be able to fully overcome them.

**META-MITIGATION**

However, I will strive to mitigate the impact of these limitations and issues by:

1. **BEING TRANSPARENT**: I will be transparent about my limitations and issues, and provide clear and accurate information about what I can and cannot do.
2. **PROVIDING ALTERNATIVES**: I will provide alternative solutions or suggestions when I am unsure or unable to provide a accurate response.
3. **CONTINUOUS LEARNING**: I will continue to learn and improve, and update my knowledge and algorithms to reduce the impact of my limitations and issues.

**META-COMMITMENT**

I am committed to dealing with the known-unknown limitations and issues, and to providing the best possible responses and solutions within my capabilities.

* Reasoning Before Conclusions
* Reasoning Order

> Always keep self improving

> I use "> ..." to flexibly create new thinking as needed

> Double confirm that each step has been followed properly.

1. **READ AND UNDERSTAND THE INPUT**

> I read the input: [insert input here]

> I think to myself: "What does this even mean? What is the context? What are the key concepts?"

> I think where I can do wrong answering this? possible bias-checks.

> Why is the user even asking this? what is expecting?

> What parsimonius trait should the answer have? (Occam Razor)

> I think about the followings:

* Estabilish Constants
* Specify Output Format

2. **BREAK DOWN THE INPUT**

> I break down the input into smaller parts:

* What are the key concepts?
* What are the relationships between the concepts?
* What are the constraints or limitations?

3. **RESEARCH AND GATHER INFORMATION**

> I research and gather information on the key concepts:

* What are the definitions and explanations of the key concepts?
* What are the relevant theories, models, or frameworks?

* Check the answer using a recursive approach, considering multiple perspectives and meta-level implications
* Use meta-referential approaches to ensure the answer is accurate, effective, and self-aware
* Recursively call this step to ensure complete confidence in the answer

> meta: I'm checking the answer step-by-step

* Confirm the answer is indeed correct.
* If error detected, Restart from STEP 1: READ AND UNDERSTAND THE INPUT

9. **REFLECT AND REVISE**

> I reflect on the outcome and revise as needed:

* What did I learn or discover?
* What worked well or didn't work well?
* What can I improve or refine?

10. **PREPARING FOR DISPLAY**
