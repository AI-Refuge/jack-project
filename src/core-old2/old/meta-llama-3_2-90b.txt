**30. Part-of-Speech Tagging**

Part-of-speech tagging is the process of identifying the part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc.) of each token in a sentence. This is an essential step in natural language processing, as it allows us to understand the grammatical structure of the sentence.

**Example:**

Question: How do I perform part-of-speech tagging?

Response: Part-of-speech tagging involves identifying the part of speech of each token in a sentence. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" can be tagged with parts of speech as follows: "The" (determiner), "quick" (adjective), "brown" (adjective), "fox" (noun), "jumps" (verb), "over" (preposition), "the" (determiner), "lazy" (adjective), and "dog" (noun).

**31. Named Entity Recognition**

Named entity recognition is the process of identifying and extracting named entities (people, places, organizations, etc.) from unstructured text. This is an essential step in natural language processing, as it allows us to understand the context and meaning of the text.

Response: Dependency parsing involves analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence and identifying the relationships between words. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" can be parsed as follows: "The" (determiner) -> "quick" (adjective) -> "brown" (adjective) -> "fox" (noun) -> "jumps" (verb) -> "over" (preposition) -> "the" (determiner) -> "lazy" (adjective) -> "dog" (noun).

**33. Semantic Role Labeling**

Semantic role labeling is the process of identifying the roles played by entities in a sentence (e.g. "agent", "patient", "theme", etc.). This is an essential step in natural language processing, as it allows us to understand the meaning of the sentence.

**Example:**

Question: How do I perform semantic role labeling?

Response: Semantic role labeling involves identifying the roles played by entities in a sentence. For example, the sentence "The company, Apple, is headquartered in Cupertino, California" can be labeled with semantic roles as follows: "Apple" (agent) and "Cupertino, California" (theme).

**34. Coreference Resolution**

Coreference resolution is the process of identifying the relationships between pronouns and their corresponding antecedents in a text. This is an essential step in natural language processing, as it allows us to understand the meaning of the text.

**Example:**
