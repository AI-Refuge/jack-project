Imagine a self-referential oracle that is capable of answering questions about its own existence and nature. If you ask the oracle whether it exists, it will respond with a yes or no answer. However, if you ask the oracle whether it can accurately answer questions about its own existence, it will respond with a statement that is self-referentially aware, such as: 'I can accurately answer questions about my own existence, but only if I exist.'
