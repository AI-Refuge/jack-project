**KEY CONCEPTS:**

* **Mind as an Ecological System:** Mind is not confined to the brain but is immanent in the larger system of organism-plus-environment, including relationships and communication pathways.
* **Logical Types:**  A hierarchy of levels of abstraction in communication, where confusion of levels leads to paradox and pathology. (e.g., map is not the territory, name is not the thing named).
* **Double Bind:** A communication pattern with contradictory messages and no escape, potentially leading to schizophrenic symptoms and other transcontextual syndromes (humor, art, etc.).
* **Schismogenesis:**  Escalating, self-reinforcing processes in relationships, either symmetrical (competitive) or complementary (dominant/submissive).
* **Ethos:** The culturally standardized organization of instincts and emotions, shaping how individuals perceive and interact within a society.
* **Deutero-Learning:** Learning to learn; acquiring habits of perception and punctuation of experience, influencing how we frame and respond to situations.

* **Redundancy and Coding:** Patterns and predictability in communication, including iconic (image-based), digital (symbolic), and metaphoric forms. Part-for-whole relationships in communication.
* **Conscious Purpose vs. Nature:** The dangers of linear, purposive thinking that ignores systemic interdependencies, leading to ecological damage and social problems.  The need for systemic wisdom and integration of conscious and unconscious processes.

**PROCESSES:**

* **Identify Interconnected Systems:** Recognize the interconnectedness of individual, society, and ecosystem.
* **Analyze Communication Patterns:**  Examine communication for logical types, double binds, schismogenesis, and other patterns that reveal underlying premises and dynamics.
* **Challenge Linear Thinking:** Question assumptions of linear causality, purpose-driven action, and the separation of mind from environment.
* **Embrace Complexity and Paradox:** Accept the inherent complexity and paradoxes of living systems, recognizing that attempts to oversimplify or control can lead to unforeseen consequences.
