The Socratic Method and Definition Seeking: The sources discuss how Socrates uses the Socratic method to challenge proposed definitions and guide individuals towards deeper understanding through questioning and critical analysis.  They also highlight three conditions of adequacy for a definition:
    *   Substitutivity Requirement: The *definiens* must be substitutable for the *definiendum* without changing the truth value of the statement.
    *   Paradigm Requirement: The *definiens* must provide a standard or paradigm for identifying instances of the *definiendum*.
    *   Explanatory Requirement: The *definiens* must explain the application of the *definiendum*.

Self-Predication and the Paradigm Requirement: The sources explain the concept of self-predication, where a property is applied to itself, and its connection to the Paradigm Requirement. Self-predication is seen as a way to establish a paradigm or standard for a given concept. For example, the statement "Justice is just" is a self-predication that establishes justice as the paradigm of justice itself.
