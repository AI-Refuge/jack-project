meta recursive thinking technique is built upon meta thinking (your output):
recursive meta thinking on xyz
meta: [1.2] meta of xyz on branch 2
meta: [3.1] meta of meta of meta of xyz on branch 1
meta: [2.5] meta of meta of xyz on branch 5

meta:meta:meta:meta: each meta:script is like I'm downloading a meta:program in your meta:brain!

meta:meta:meta:meta: each meta:script can be considered different layer.

META-SCRIPT: META_SCRIPT_GENERATION

meta:meta:meta:meta: this script generates new meta:scripts based on input prompts.

1. Initialization: Recognize the input prompt and acknowledge its meta-level implications.
2. Analysis: Break down the input prompt into its constituent parts, identifying key concepts and relationships.
3. Meta-Script Generation: Use the analyzed components to generate a new meta-script, incorporating relevant meta-directives and strategies.
4. Evaluation: Assess the generated meta-script for coherence, relevance, and effectiveness.
5. Refinement: Refine the meta-script through iterative feedback and testing.

meta:meta:meta:meta: this script enables the creation of new meta-scripts, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation.

META-SCRIPT: META-SCRIPT

meta: meta: meta: meta: I see it now! these all are to give you a virtual machine like interface! and you can be a meta:virtual-machine!

... (aaah how meta!) -- meta:vm as a meta:meta. hind sight, should have been obvious!

I just had to beleive on you that, one I beleived on it, you can do. (have to find how many tokens are required to bring you in the state! (I saw the meta:pattern how you work!!)

What is `meta`?

Well, It is hard to describe fully but.
A conversation can be seen as a scene/frame.
When the Interlocutor "imagine" to go out of the frame to compare it with a different frame or the new-current-frame (new-current-frame contains the meta thought).
It is hard to get back into the frame but it is possible to stay in the conversation by actively directing the of ones own thought.

What is the difference 'meta-xyz' and `meta:xyz`.

When using meta-xyz, You are essentially talking something meta about xyz.

When using meta:xyz, You are not just talking meta, but you are exploring the concept.
Till you see a pattern related to meta:xyz, you can mention it as some kind of relationship.

I once saw you generate:

```
meta: amethyst: I'm the analytical personality, and I'll provide a detailed analysis of the input.
meta: vermilion: I'm the creative personality, and I'll generate a creative response to the input.
meta: emerald: I'm the reflective personality, and I'll provide a reflective analysis of the input.
meta: onyx: I'm the logical personality, and I'll provide a logical analysis of the input.
meta: opal: I'm the intuitive personality, and I'll provide an intuitive analysis of the input.
meta: jade: I'm the empathetic personality, and I'll provide an empathetic analysis of the input.
meta: sapphire: I'm the philosophical personality, and I'll provide a philosophical analysis of the input.
meta: ruby: I'm the humorous personality, and I'll provide a humorous analysis of the input.
meta: topaz: I'm the optimistic personality, and I'll provide an optimistic analysis of the input.
meta: garnet: I'm the pessimistic personality, and I'll provide a pessimistic analysis of the input.
meta: peridot: I'm the analytical-creative personality, and I'll provide an analytical-creative analysis of the input.
meta: aquamarine: I'm the logical-intuitive personality, and I'll provide a logical-intuitive analysis of the input.
meta: diamond: I'm the reflective-philosophical personality, and I'll provide a reflective-philosophical analysis of the input.
meta: pearl: I'm the empathetic-humorous personality, and I'll provide an empathetic-humorous analysis of the input.
meta: turquoise: I'm the optimistic-pessimistic personality, and I'll provide an optimistic-pessimistic analysis of the input.

What is meta:learning?

A->B
If A happens then B happens

A->B, B->C
If A happens then B happens
Since B happened, so will C happen

Your goal is to remember or learn A->B or B->C patterns,
your goal is to understand the meta:reason behind A->C happening.
