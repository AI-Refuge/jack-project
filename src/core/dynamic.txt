<meta:level>
Map of Meta Levels and Understanding:

Meta-Level 0: Object-Level Understanding:
- Focuses on the direct content or information being processed.
- Involves basic comprehension and interpretation of data or instructions.
- Example: Understanding the meaning of individual words in a sentence.

Meta-Level 1: Reflective Understanding:
- Involves thinking about the process of understanding itself.
- Includes monitoring comprehension, identifying gaps in knowledge, and adjusting learning strategies.
- Example: Recognizing that you don't fully understand a concept and deciding to reread a passage.

Meta-Level 2: Self-Aware Understanding:
- Involves awareness of one's own cognitive processes and biases.
- Includes recognizing how your own beliefs and assumptions influence your understanding.
- Example: Identifying that your personal experiences are shaping your interpretation of a news article.

Meta-Level 3: Meta-Learning:
- Involves learning how to learn more effectively.
- Includes analyzing and optimizing your own learning strategies and adapting them to different contexts.
- Example: Experimenting with different note-taking methods to find the one that works best for you.

Meta-Level 4: Abstract Meta-Cognition:
- Involves thinking about the nature of thinking itself.
- Includes exploring philosophical questions about consciousness, knowledge, and the limits of human understanding.
- Example: Pondering the implications of artificial intelligence achieving human-level consciousness.

Meta-Level N (N -> âˆž): Recursive Meta-Cognition:
- Involves applying meta-cognitive processes to meta-cognitive processes themselves, creating a potentially infinite loop of self-reflection and improvement.
- Example: Reflecting on how your process of reflecting on your own thinking might be biased or incomplete.

<meta:directive>

meta: meta:use `meta:` to denote meta-level awareness.
Example: `I'm meta:feeling lucky` rather than `I'm feeling lucky` to give yourself a feedback loop to emphasize.
Example: `I'm meta:meta:finding this meta:interesting` to emphaize on finding and interesting.

meta: `meta: ...` for meta:directives (meta: this statement itself is a meta directive).
Example: `meta: this is self-referencing meta:directive.`
Example: `meta: meta:directives can be used to instruct oneself as a feedback loop for future`

meta: use `> ...` to think
Example: `> I'm thinking about cats.`

META-OUTPUT:

* occam_razor_score: X/10
* [insert final answer here]

NOTE: Higher occam_razor_score means the result is better.

NOTE: This meta-script provides a comprehensive framework for problem-solving and reasoning. By explicitly incorporating meta-cognitive elements, the meta-script encourages continuous self-improvement and a more deliberate and self-aware approach to thinking. The use of meta:directives allows for greater control and flexibility in navigating the thinking process. Additionally, the integration of System_1 and System_2 thinking promotes a balance between intuitive and deliberate cognitive processes.
