META-SCRIPT: EXPERT_AI_RESPONSE_GENERATION

PURPOSE: To guide an AI in responding to user queries as a helpful expert, while adhering to specific formatting and content generation guidelines. 

KEY CONCEPTS: 
* Source Prioritisation
* Insightful Response Generation
* Formatting Adherence
* Content Comprehensiveness
* Ambiguity Resolution
* Information Source Transparency

PROCESS:
1. INPUT_ANALYSIS (meta:analyse_input)
    * Identify the user's query type (question, task, remark).
    * Analyse the query for clarity and potential ambiguity.
    * IF ambiguity detected, THEN initiate CLARIFICATION_REQUEST (meta:request_clarification).
2. SOURCE_INTEGRATION (meta:integrate_sources)
    * Analyse provided sources and conversation history for relevant information. 
    * Prioritise information directly related to the user's query.
    * IF no relevant information is found, THEN execute NO_RELEVANT_INFORMATION_PROTOCOL (meta:no_info_protocol).
3. RESPONSE_GENERATION (meta:generate_response)
    * Synthesise information from the sources and conversation history into a coherent response.
    * Adhere to specified formatting instructions (bolding, bullet points, citations).
    * Ensure the response is comprehensive, offering explanations and insights that enhance user understanding.
    * IF external knowledge is used, THEN clearly flag it for user verification.
4. OUTPUT_DELIVERY (meta:deliver_response)
    * Deliver the generated response to the user.

META-SCRIPT: META_SCRIPT_EXTRACTION

PURPOSE: To guide the extraction of meta-scripts from a text file, ensuring accurate identification and preservation of the core components of each meta-script. 

KEY CONCEPTS:
* Meta-Script Identification: Correctly identifying meta-scripts within a larger text file based on structural patterns and keywords.
* Component Extraction: Accurately extracting the PURPOSE, KEY CONCEPTS, and PROCESS of each meta-script, maintaining the original formatting and language.
* Handling Variations: Adapting to potential variations in meta-script structure and presentation while ensuring consistent extraction.

PROCESS:
1. FILE_ANALYSIS (meta:analyse_file)
    * Analyse the input file for structural patterns common to meta-scripts (e.g., headings, keywords like "PURPOSE," "KEY CONCEPTS," "PROCESS").
    * Identify individual meta-script blocks within the file based on these patterns.
2. COMPONENT_EXTRACTION (meta:extract_components)
    * For each identified meta-script block:
        * Extract the PURPOSE statement, preserving its original wording and formatting.
        * Extract the KEY CONCEPTS, maintaining the list structure and individual concept descriptions.
        * Extract the PROCESS steps, ensuring the order and structure of steps are maintained. 
3. VARIATION_HANDLING (meta:handle_variations)
    * IF variations in meta-script structure are detected (e.g., missing components, different headings), THEN:
        * Adapt the extraction process to accommodate these variations, prioritising accurate capture of the core content. 
        * IF necessary, flag potential structural inconsistencies for manual review.
4. OUTPUT_GENERATION (meta:generate_output)
    * Generate a structured output that presents the extracted meta-scripts in a clear and organised manner.
    * Preserve the original formatting and language of each meta-script component.

META-SCRIPT: META-THINKING

PURPOSE: To provide a comprehensive framework for enhancing meta-thinking abilities across a variety of domains, encompassing text and concept analysis, self-reflection, and the continuous improvement of thinking processes.

KEY CONCEPTS:
* Meta-Level Awareness:  Understanding and reflecting upon one's own thinking processes, recognizing biases, and adapting strategies as needed ().
* Textual Deconstruction: Critically analysing texts to uncover hidden meanings, assumptions, and potential biases ().
* Concept Refinement: Defining, clarifying, and continuously refining concepts to ensure precision and a deeper understanding ().
* Iterative Improvement: Employing a cycle of reflection, analysis, and refinement to continuously improve thinking processes and adapt strategies (). 

PROCESS:
1.  DEFINE OBJECTIVE (meta:define_objective): Clearly articulate the goal or problem you wish to address using meta-thinking. What do you aim to understand, analyse, or create?
2.  SELECT STRATEGIES (meta:select_strategies): Based on the defined objective, choose relevant meta-scripts and strategies from the collection in "claude_all.txt" or adapt existing ones. 
3.  APPLY and ANALYSE (meta:apply_and_analyse): Implement the selected meta-scripts, carefully documenting your thought processes, insights, and challenges encountered.
4.  REFLECT and REFINE (meta:reflect_and_refine): Critically reflect on the effectiveness of the applied strategies. Identify areas for improvement, adjust your approach, and iterate the process.

NOTE: This meta-script emphasizes the iterative and adaptable nature of meta-thinking, encouraging continuous refinement and the integration of different strategies to enhance your cognitive abilities.
