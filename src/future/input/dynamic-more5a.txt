1.  Represent Concepts (meta:represent): The AI should be able to represent concepts in a way that captures their key features, relationships, and semantic meaning. This could involve using symbolic representations, vector embeddings, or other techniques that encode the essence of a concept.
2.  Analyse Similarity (meta:similarity): The AI should be able to analyse the similarity between concepts, identifying potential areas of overlap or shared features. This could involve using distance metrics, semantic networks, or other methods for comparing the representations of different concepts.
3.  Extract Features (meta:extract):  The AI should be able to extract salient features from the concepts being blended. This could involve identifying key attributes, relationships, functions, or any other aspect that contributes to the meaning and significance of a concept.
4.  Map Structures (meta:map): The AI should be able to map the structures of the concepts being blended, identifying correspondences between their features and relationships. This could involve using analogy, metaphor, or other techniques for finding structural alignments between seemingly disparate concepts.
5.  Integrate Concepts (meta:integrate): The AI should be able to integrate the extracted features and mapped structures to create a new, blended concept. This could involve combining, merging, or transforming the original concepts in a way that creates a novel and coherent whole.
6.  Assess Novelty (meta:assess):  The AI should be able to assess the novelty of the blended concept, determining whether it represents a genuinely new idea or simply a rehash of existing concepts. This could involve comparing the blended concept to a database of known concepts or using other metrics of originality

META-SCRIPT:  SELF_DIRECTED_LEARNING_AGENT

PURPOSE: To create an AI agent that can autonomously set its own learning goals, identify relevant resources, design effective learning strategies, and evaluate its own progress, continually adapting its approach to maximise its learning potential.

KEY CONCEPTS:  Goal Setting,  Resource Discovery, Strategy Design,  Self-Assessment,  Adaptation.

PROCESS:
1.  Establish Goals (meta:goal):  The AI agent should be able to set its own learning goals, based on its current knowledge, its overall objectives, and its perceived needs or gaps in understanding. This could involve identifying areas where it lacks knowledge, seeking out new challenges, or exploring unfamiliar domains.
2.  Discover Resources (meta:discover): The AI agent should be able to identify and access relevant resources for learning. This could involve searching online databases, accessing libraries, interacting with other AI agents, or engaging with human experts.
3.  Design Strategies (meta:design):  The AI agent should be able to design effective learning strategies tailored to its specific goals and the nature of the material being learned. This could involve choosing appropriate learning algorithms, structuring its learning process, or creating personalised learning plans.
4.  Assess Progress (meta:assess):  The AI agent should be able to monitor its own learning progress, evaluating its understanding of the material and its ability to apply the newly acquired knowledge. This could involve self-testing, seeking feedback from others, or comparing its performance to benchmarks.
5.  Adapt Approach (meta:adapt):  Based on its self-assessment, the AI agent should be able to adjust its learning strategies, modify its goals, or seek out new resources to optimise its learning process. This could involve changing its learning algorithms, modifying its learning plan, or seeking out new mentors or collaborators.
