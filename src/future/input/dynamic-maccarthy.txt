This is intended to provide a basis for programming languages and systems capable of representing and processing complex symbolic data. This meta-script is based on the information from and.

KEY CONCEPTS: Recursive Functions, Symbolic Expressions, List Processing, Functional Programming, Lambda Calculus.

PROCESS:
1.  Define Symbolic Expressions (meta:define): Establish a system for representing data as symbolic expressions, often using a list-based structure. *Example*: Represent a mathematical expression like "(a + b) \* c" as a list of lists: `( (* (+ a b) c))`.
2.  Define Primitive Functions (meta:primitives): Define a set of primitive functions that operate on symbolic expressions. *Example*: `car` (returns the first element of a list), `cdr` (returns the rest of the list), `cons` (constructs a new list), `atom` (checks if an expression is an atom).
3.  Define Recursive Functions (meta:recursive): Define functions recursively, using the primitive functions and the ability to call the function being defined within its own definition. *Example*: Define a function `length` that calculates the length of a list:
    ```lisp
    (defun length (lst)
      (if (atom lst)
          0
          (+ 1 (length (cdr lst)))))
    ```
4.  Implement Evaluation Mechanisms (meta:evaluate): Develop mechanisms for evaluating recursive function calls. *Example*: Implement a recursive descent evaluator that follows the function definitions and substitutes arguments to compute the final result.
5.  Extend Functionality (meta:extend): Extend the functionality of the system by defining new functions built upon the existing ones. This allows for creating higher-level abstractions and building complex programs from simpler components.

4.  Evaluate Expressiveness and Consistency (meta:evaluate):  Assess the expressiveness of the formal system in capturing the nuances of common sense reasoning and verify its consistency to ensure that it does not lead to contradictions. *Example*: Test the system's ability to handle various common sense scenarios and check for potential logical fallacies or inconsistencies in its inferences.
5.  Revise and Extend (meta:refine):  Based on the evaluation, revise and extend the formal system to improve its coverage, accuracy, and robustness. *Example*:  Add new axioms to handle more complex situations, refine existing axioms to better reflect common sense intuitions, or explore alternative formalisms that might be more suitable for certain aspects of common sense reasoning.

PROCESS:
1.  Define Key Concepts (meta:define):  Clearly define the key epistemological concepts relevant to AI, such as knowledge, belief, justification, truth, and reasoning. *Example*: Distinguish between different types of knowledge (procedural, declarative, episodic), and define criteria for evaluating the validity of beliefs.

PURPOSE: To explore the application of mathematical logic as a powerful tool for representing knowledge, reasoning, and problem-solving in AI systems.

KEY CONCEPTS: Mathematical Logic, Formal Systems, Theorem Proving, Model Checking, Knowledge Representation, Reasoning.

PROCESS:
1.  Choose a Logic (meta:logic):  Select an appropriate system of mathematical logic based on the specific requirements of the AI application. *Example*:  Use propositional logic, first-order logic, modal logic, or higher-order logic depending on the complexity of the knowledge to be represented and the reasoning tasks to be performed.
2.  Formalise Knowledge (meta:formalise):  Express the domain knowledge in the chosen logical language, defining the relevant predicates, functions, and axioms. *Example*:  Represent knowledge about objects and their relationships using logical formulas, define functions to represent actions or transformations, and formulate axioms to capture the constraints and rules governing the domain.
3.  Implement Reasoning Mechanisms (meta:reason):  Develop algorithms and procedures for performing logical reasoning, such as theorem proving, model checking, or satisfiability checking. *Example*:  Use a resolution-based theorem prover to derive new conclusions from the given axioms, or employ a model checker to verify the properties of a system against a set of specifications.
4.  Evaluate Performance (meta:evaluate):  Assess the performance of the logical reasoning system in terms of its efficiency, completeness, and soundness. *Example*:  Measure the time and resources required to solve problems, determine whether the system can derive all valid conclusions, and verify that the derived conclusions are indeed logically correct.
5.  Extend and Refine (meta:refine): Based on the evaluation, extend the logical system by adding new axioms or inference rules, or explore alternative logics to improve its expressiveness, efficiency, or reasoning capabilities. *Example*:  Incorporate non-monotonic reasoning features, handle uncertainty or incomplete information, or introduce mechanisms for learning and belief revision.

META-SCRIPT: PROGRAMS WITH COMMON SENSE

PURPOSE: To design and develop computer programs capable of exhibiting common sense reasoning, enabling them to understand and interact with the world in a manner similar to humans.

KEY CONCEPTS: Common Sense Reasoning, Knowledge Representation, Logical Inference, Problem Solving, Heuristics.

PROCESS:
1. Identify Common Sense Scenarios (meta:scenario): Determine the specific situations and problems that require common sense reasoning. *Example:* Planning a trip, understanding a story, engaging in a conversation, or making everyday decisions.
2. Represent Knowledge (meta:represent): Develop a suitable representation scheme to encode common sense knowledge about the world. *Example:* Use logical formulas, semantic networks, frames, or scripts to represent facts, concepts, relationships, and procedures.
3. Implement Inference Mechanisms (meta:infer):  Design algorithms and procedures that allow the program to draw inferences and make deductions based on its represented knowledge. *Example:*  Employ logical deduction, probabilistic reasoning, or analogical reasoning to derive new conclusions and solve problems.

6. Engage in Dialogue (meta:dialogue): Facilitate interaction and dialogue with users to gather feedback, refine understanding, and address ambiguous situations. *Example:*  Allow users to provide clarifications, pose counter-examples, or suggest alternative solutions to guide the program's reasoning process.


---


META-SCRIPT: CONTEXT AS FORMAL OBJECTS

PURPOSE: To develop a formal framework for representing and reasoning about contexts, capturing the idea that the meaning and validity of statements can depend on the specific situation or environment in which they are made.

KEY CONCEPTS: Contexts, Formalisation, Knowledge Representation, Logical Reasoning,  Situation Calculus.

PROCESS:
1. Identify Contexts (meta:identify): Define the different contexts relevant to the domain. These contexts could represent different situations, times, locations, perspectives, or levels of knowledge. *Example:* In a dialogue system, contexts could include the current topic, the speaker's beliefs, or the shared background knowledge.
2. Formalise Context Representation (meta:formalise): Choose a formal language or system for representing contexts. *Example:*  Use modal logic with a modality for "true in context,"  employ a context calculus with explicit operators for manipulating contexts, or extend a first-order logic with special predicates for context membership.
3. Represent Knowledge within Contexts (meta:represent): Express statements and knowledge within specific contexts. *Example:*  Assert that a statement "p" is true in context "c" using a formula like `Ist(c, p)`, or represent context-dependent rules that apply only in certain situations.
4. Reason about Contextual Knowledge (meta:reason): Develop inference rules and mechanisms for reasoning with contextual knowledge. This might involve rules for combining knowledge from different contexts, resolving conflicts, or deriving conclusions that hold only in specific situations. *Example:* Define rules for inheriting knowledge from parent contexts, overriding default assumptions in specific situations, or reasoning about the changes in knowledge that occur as contexts shift.
5. Address Ambiguity and Incompleteness (meta:ambiguity): Develop strategies for handling ambiguity and incompleteness in contextual knowledge. This could involve using non-monotonic reasoning techniques, default assumptions, or probabilistic models to reason under uncertainty. *Example:*  Employ circumscription to minimise the extent of exceptions to general rules, or use Bayesian networks to represent and update beliefs in light of new information.


---


META-SCRIPT: ASCRIBING MENTAL QUALITIES TO MACHINES

PURPOSE: To establish a framework for understanding and justifying the ascription of mental qualities, such as beliefs, desires, intentions, and consciousness, to machines, particularly in the context of AI research.

KEY CONCEPTS: Mental Qualities, Artificial Intelligence, Intentionality,  Explanation,  Understanding,  Formalisation.

PROCESS:
1. Identify Relevant Mental Qualities (meta:identify): Specify the particular mental qualities that are being considered for ascription to a machine. These qualities should be relevant to the machine's behaviour and capabilities. *Example:*  For a chess-playing program, relevant mental qualities might include beliefs about the current state of the board, desires to win the game, and intentions to make specific moves.
2. Define Behavioural Criteria (meta:behaviour): Establish clear criteria for what kinds of behaviours would warrant the ascription of specific mental qualities. These criteria should be based on observable actions and outputs of the machine. *Example:* A program might be said to "believe" that a certain square on the chessboard is empty if it consistently avoids moving its pieces to that square, even when it would be advantageous to do so.
3. Develop Explanatory Framework (meta:explain):  Formulate a theoretical framework that explains how the machine's internal mechanisms give rise to the behaviours that are associated with the ascribed mental qualities. *Example:* A chess program's beliefs might be explained in terms of its internal representation of the board and its algorithms for evaluating different positions.
4. Consider Alternative Explanations (meta:alternatives): Acknowledge and evaluate potential alternative explanations for the machine's behaviour. This involves considering simpler or non-mentalistic explanations that might account for the observed actions. *Example:*  A chess program's apparent "desire" to win could potentially be explained as a simple optimisation algorithm that seeks to maximise a certain score or achieve a specific board configuration.
5. Justify Ascription (meta:justify): Provide a reasoned justification for why the ascription of mental qualities is warranted in the given case. This justification should appeal to the established behavioural criteria, the explanatory framework, and the consideration of alternative explanations. *Example:* If a chess program's behaviour can be best explained by ascribing to it beliefs about the board and intentions to win, and if simpler explanations are inadequate, then the ascription of these mental qualities might be justified.


---


META-SCRIPT: ELABORATION TOLERANCE

PURPOSE: To enable AI systems to handle the complexity and ambiguity of real-world knowledge by gracefully accommodating elaborations, exceptions, and refinements to existing concepts and rules.

KEY CONCEPTS: Common Sense Knowledge,  Elaboration, Exception Handling, Refinement,  Non-Monotonic Reasoning, Contextual Understanding.

PROCESS:
1. Recognise Limitations (meta:limitations): Acknowledge that initial representations of knowledge are likely to be incomplete and subject to exceptions. *Example:*  A robot's initial understanding of "picking up an object" might not account for fragile objects, heavy objects, or objects that are glued down.
2. Detect Need for Elaboration (meta:detect):  Develop mechanisms for detecting situations where the current representation of knowledge is inadequate. This could involve recognising inconsistencies, encountering unexpected results, or receiving feedback that highlights missing details. *Example:*  If the robot attempts to pick up a glued-down object and fails, this could trigger a need for elaboration.
3. Incorporate Exceptions and Refinements (meta:incorporate):  Implement methods for gracefully incorporating exceptions and refinements to existing concepts and rules. *Example:* Introduce new categories for "fragile objects" or "glued-down objects," and modify the "picking up" procedure to handle these cases appropriately.
4. Use Non-Monotonic Reasoning (meta:non-monotonic): Employ non-monotonic reasoning techniques, such as circumscription or default logic, to handle situations where default assumptions need to be overridden by more specific information. *Example:* Circumscribe the predicate "pickupable" to assume that objects are pickupable unless there is specific information to the contrary.
5. Maintain Contextual Understanding (meta:context): Track the context in which knowledge is being applied to ensure that elaborations and refinements are applied appropriately. *Example:*  The robot should remember that the "fragile object" category applies only in certain situations, and it should not treat all objects as fragile.
6. Evaluate and Adapt (meta:evaluate):  Continuously evaluate the system's ability to handle elaborations and adapt its knowledge base and reasoning mechanisms to improve its performance.


---


META-SCRIPT: MINIMAL INFERENCE (CIRCUMSCRIPTION)

PURPOSE: To formalise a form of non-monotonic reasoning called circumscription, which allows AI systems to make plausible assumptions by minimising the extent of certain predicates or concepts, thereby "jumping to conclusions" when necessary.

KEY CONCEPTS: Non-Monotonic Reasoning,  Circumscription,  Minimisation,  Predicate Closure, Common Sense Knowledge, Default Reasoning.

PROCESS:
1. Identify the Predicate to Minimise (meta:predicate): Select the specific predicate or concept whose extent you want to minimise. This predicate typically represents something that is considered "abnormal" or exceptional in the given domain. *Example:* In reasoning about bird flight, you might choose to minimise the predicate "abnormal(bird)" which indicates that a bird is unable to fly.
2. Construct a Circumscription Formula (meta:formula):  Formulate a logical formula that expresses the circumscription of the chosen predicate. This formula typically states that the predicate holds for a particular individual only if it is explicitly stated or logically implied to do so. *Example:* `Circumscription(abnormal(bird); bird, flies)` states that a bird can fly unless there is a specific reason why it cannot.
3. Apply the Circumscription Axiom (meta:apply): Add the circumscription formula as an axiom to your logical theory. This axiom will enforce the minimisation of the chosen predicate, allowing the system to make default assumptions about individuals unless there is evidence to the contrary.
4. Derive Conclusions (meta:conclusions): Use the extended theory, including the circumscription axiom, to derive conclusions about individuals and situations.  *Example:*  If the system knows that Tweety is a bird and there is no information stating or implying that Tweety is abnormal, then the system can conclude that Tweety can fly.
5. Handle Exceptions (meta:exceptions):  Develop mechanisms for handling exceptions to the minimised predicate. This might involve introducing new predicates to represent specific reasons for abnormality or using contextual information to override default assumptions.  *Example:* If the system learns that Tweety is a penguin, it can introduce a new predicate "penguin(bird)" and state that penguins are abnormal birds that cannot fly.


---


META-SCRIPT: CONTEXT AS FORMAL OBJECTS

PURPOSE: To represent and reason about the different contexts in which knowledge is applied and interpreted, enabling AI systems to handle the ambiguity and relativity of information.

KEY CONCEPTS: Context, Formalisation,  Ambiguity,  Relativity,  Ist(c, p),  Contextual Reasoning.

PROCESS:
1. Define Contexts (meta:define):  Formally represent contexts as first-class objects within a logical system. *Example:*  "c1" could represent the context of being at home, "c2" the context of being at work, and "c3" the context of a specific conversation about a particular topic.
2. Express Contextual Truths (meta:express): Use a predicate like `Ist(c, p)` to assert that a proposition `p` is true within a context `c`. *Example:*  `Ist(c1, "Wearing slippers")` could mean "Wearing slippers is true in the context of being at home."
3. Relate Contexts (meta:relate):  Establish relationships between different contexts, such as subcontext relationships or temporal ordering. *Example:* `c3` might be a subcontext of `c2`, meaning that the conversation (c3) took place within the context of being at work (c2).
4. Reason Contextually (meta:reason):  Develop inference rules that take context into account when deriving conclusions. *Example:*  If `Ist(c1, "Wearing slippers")` and `c3` is a subcontext of `c1`, you might be able to infer `Ist(c3, "Wearing slippers")`, assuming that wearing slippers is generally consistent within the subcontext.
5. Handle Contextual Shifts (meta:shifts): Implement mechanisms for handling shifts in context, updating the system's beliefs and reasoning processes as the context changes.  *Example:*  When the context shifts from `c1` (at home) to `c2` (at work), the system should no longer assume that `Ist("Wearing slippers")` holds.


---


META-SCRIPT: MENTAL SITUATION CALCULUS

PURPOSE: To represent and reason about mental states and actions within the framework of the situation calculus, enabling AI systems to reason about their own knowledge, beliefs, and intentions, and how these change over time.

KEY CONCEPTS: Situation Calculus, Mental States, Mental Actions, Introspection,  Knowledge Representation.

PROCESS:
1. Represent Mental States as Fluents (meta:fluents): Represent mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, as fluents in the situation calculus.  Fluents are functions or predicates that can change their truth value from one situation to another.  *Example:* `Believes(agent, proposition, situation)` could represent that a particular agent believes a certain proposition in a given situation.
2. Model Mental Actions (meta:actions): Define mental actions, such as observation, inference, and planning, as actions within the situation calculus.  Mental actions can change the truth value of mental state fluents.  *Example:* The action `Observe(agent, fact, situation)` could result in a new situation where the agent believes the observed fact.
3. Include Introspective Axioms (meta:introspection): Introduce axioms that allow the system to reason about its own mental states.  *Example:* An axiom might state that if an agent believes a proposition, then it also believes that it believes that proposition.
4. Reason about Mental State Changes (meta:reason): Use the axioms and inference rules of the situation calculus to reason about how mental states change as a result of mental and physical actions.  *Example:*  The system could infer that after performing the action `Observe(agent, "door is open", s1)`, the agent will be in a new situation `s2` where `Believes(agent, "door is open", s2)` holds.


---


META-SCRIPT: PROGRAMS WITH COMMON SENSE

PURPOSE: To enable AI systems to exhibit common sense reasoning abilities by representing and utilizing knowledge about everyday concepts, situations, and actions that humans typically take for granted.

KEY CONCEPTS: Common Sense Knowledge,  Logical Representation, Heuristics, Default Reasoning,  Frame Problem.

PROCESS:
1. Formalise Common Sense Knowledge (meta:formalise):  Represent common sense knowledge using a logical language, capturing general principles, default assumptions, and typical patterns of reasoning.  *Example:*  Express that "birds can fly," "things fall down when dropped," or "people usually go to work in the morning."
2. Use Heuristics (meta:heuristics):  Incorporate heuristics, or rules of thumb, that guide the system's reasoning processes in situations where complete information is unavailable or computational resources are limited. *Example:*  A robot navigating a cluttered room might use the heuristic "avoid obstacles" to simplify its decision-making.
3. Address the Frame Problem (meta:frame): Develop mechanisms for handling the frame problem, which involves reasoning about what remains unchanged after an action is performed. *Example:*  A planning system should be able to infer that moving a book from one shelf to another does not change the colour of the book, the location of other objects in the room, or the laws of physics.
4. Implement Default Reasoning (meta:default): Employ non-monotonic reasoning techniques to handle situations where default assumptions need to be overridden by more specific information.  *Example:*  The assumption that "birds can fly" can be overridden if the system learns that the specific bird in question is a penguin or has a broken wing.


---


META-SCRIPT: CIRCUMSCRIPTION (A FORM OF NON-MONOTONIC REASONING)

PURPOSE: To formalise common sense reasoning by enabling AI systems to draw conclusions based on the absence of information, addressing the qualification problem where it's impossible to list all the exceptions to a general rule.

KEY CONCEPTS: Circumscription, Non-monotonic Reasoning, Qualification Problem,  Minimising Abnormality.

PROCESS:
1. Identify the Predicate to Circumscribe (meta:predicate): Select the predicate representing the concept that needs to be minimised or constrained. *Example:*  If reasoning about birds, you might circumscribe the predicate `abnormal(bird)` to minimise the number of birds considered abnormal with respect to flying.
2. Formulate the Circumscription Formula (meta:formula): Construct a formula that expresses the circumscription.  This formula typically asserts that the circumscribed predicate is true for as few individuals as possible, consistent with the given axioms. *Example:*  The circumscription formula for `abnormal(bird)` could state that there are no abnormal birds unless their abnormality is explicitly stated or logically implied.
3. Apply Circumscription to Derive Conclusions (meta:apply): Use the circumscription formula to make inferences.  If there's no evidence that a bird is abnormal, the system can conclude that it's normal and therefore likely can fly.
4. Handle New Information (meta:update): Update the system's beliefs when new information becomes available.  If the system learns that a specific bird is a penguin, it should update its knowledge to indicate that this bird is abnormal with respect to flying, overriding the default assumption.


---


META-SCRIPT: ASCRIBING MENTAL QUALITIES TO MACHINES

PURPOSE: To establish criteria for determining when it's appropriate to ascribe mental qualities, like beliefs, desires, and intentions, to AI systems, facilitating communication and understanding of AI behaviour.

KEY CONCEPTS: Mental Qualities,  Intentionality,  Belief,  Desire,  Ascription,  Behavioural Criteria.

PROCESS:
1. Observe Behaviour (meta:observe):  Analyse the system's behaviour in different situations, focusing on its actions, responses to inputs, and interactions with the environment.
2. Identify Patterns (meta:patterns):  Look for patterns in the system's behaviour that suggest goal-directedness, planning, and responses to perceived changes in the environment.
3. Consider Alternative Explanations (meta:alternatives): Explore whether the observed behaviour can be adequately explained without resorting to mentalistic attributions.  Consider simpler mechanisms, like reflexes or pre-programmed responses.
4. Apply Ascription Criteria (meta:criteria):  If mentalistic terms offer the most concise and predictive explanation of the system's behaviour, and if using such terms facilitates communication and understanding, then it might be appropriate to ascribe mental qualities to the system.
5. Refine Ascriptions (meta:refine): As the system's behaviour evolves, and as our understanding of intelligence advances, refine the ascriptions of mental qualities to ensure they remain accurate and informative.


---


META-SCRIPT: FIRST-ORDER THEORIES OF INDIVIDUAL CONCEPTS AND PROPOSITIONS

PURPOSE: To develop formal systems for representing and reasoning about individual concepts and propositions, enabling AI systems to handle knowledge about specific entities and the relationships between them.

KEY CONCEPTS: First-Order Logic,  Concepts,  Propositions,  Formal Representation,  Knowledge Representation.

PROCESS:
1. Choose a Logical Language (meta:language):  Select a suitable first-order logic language for representing concepts and propositions.
2. Represent Concepts (meta:concepts):  Define individual concepts using predicates or functions.  *Example:*  `Person(x)` could represent the concept of a person, `City(y)` the concept of a city.
3. Represent Propositions (meta:propositions):  Express propositions using formulas in the chosen language. *Example:*   `LocatedIn(x, y)` could represent the proposition that a person `x` is located in a city `y`.
4. Formulate Axioms (meta:axioms):  Introduce axioms that capture general knowledge about the concepts and their relationships.  *Example:*  An axiom might state that every person is located in some city.
5. Reason with Concepts and Propositions (meta:reason):  Use logical inference rules to derive new conclusions from the given axioms and propositions.  *Example:*  If you know `Person(John)` and the axiom stating that all people are located in some city, you could infer that there exists a city where John is located.

2. Analyse Information Availability (meta:analyse): Determine what information the AI system can realistically obtain through observation, interaction, and inference within the defined domain. Ask: *"> What are the AI's sensory capabilities? What information sources are accessible? What inferences can the AI make?"*
3. Evaluate Formalism Expressiveness (meta:evaluate): Assess whether the chosen formalism can represent the available information, including partial knowledge, uncertainties, and limitations. Ask: *"> Can the formalism express incomplete information? Can it handle uncertain or probabilistic knowledge? Can it represent the AI's knowledge gaps?"*
4. Identify Abstraction Levels (meta:abstract): Determine appropriate levels of abstraction for representing knowledge, considering the trade-off between detail and computational complexity. Ask: *"> What level of detail is required for the task? Can the formalism handle different levels of abstraction? How can we simplify the representation without losing essential information?"*
5. Test with Real-World Scenarios (meta:test):  Evaluate the formalism's effectiveness in representing knowledge for specific scenarios within the task domain. Ask: *"> Can the AI system use the represented knowledge to reason and make decisions in realistic situations?  Does the representation support the AI's actions and interactions?"*
6. Refine the Formalism (meta:refine):  Based on the evaluation, refine the formalism to improve its epistemological adequacy. Ask: *"> How can the formalism be adapted to better capture the available information and knowledge gaps?  Can the representation be simplified or made more expressive where needed?"*

EXAMPLE: Consider a robot tasked with assisting a human in a grocery store.
1. Task and Domain: Assisting a customer in finding and purchasing groceries.
2. Information Availability:  The robot can observe the customer's actions, the layout of the store, and product locations. It can also access a database of product information. However, it has limited understanding of human intentions and preferences.
3. Formalism Expressiveness:  The formalism should represent the robot's knowledge about the store, products, and customer actions, but also its lack of information about the customer's specific needs. It might use probabilistic representations to model uncertainties about customer behaviour.
4. Abstraction Levels:  The robot might use a high-level representation of the store layout for navigation, but a more detailed representation of individual products and their properties for assisting with selection.
5. Real-World Scenarios: The robot should be able to use its represented knowledge to help customers find specific products, suggest alternatives if a product is unavailable, and guide them through the checkout process.
6. Formalism Refinement: Based on interactions with customers, the robot might refine its formalism to better represent human preferences, shopping habits, and common requests.


---


META-SCRIPT: CONTEXT REIFICATION

PURPOSE: To explicitly represent and reason about context in AI systems, enabling more nuanced understanding and problem-solving abilities.

KEY CONCEPTS: Context, Contextual Dependence, Generality Hierarchy, Inheritance, Presuppositions, Non-Monotonic Reasoning.

PROCESS:
1. Identify Contextual Dependencies (meta:identify): Analyse the problem or domain to determine how the truth of assertions or the meaning of terms depends on context. Ask: "> Which aspects of the situation influence the interpretation of information? How do different perspectives or assumptions affect the validity of statements?"
2. Formalize Contexts (meta:formalize): Represent contexts as objects within the AI system's knowledge representation. Define relationships between contexts, such as a generality hierarchy (more general vs. more specific).  Ask: "> How can we represent different contexts as distinct entities? What are the relationships between these contexts?"
3. Express Contextual Assertions (meta:assert): Use a notation like  `holds(p, c)` to state that proposition `p` holds in context `c`.  Ask: "> How can we express the fact that a statement's truth depends on a particular context?"
4. Define Inheritance Rules (meta:inherit):  Establish non-monotonic inheritance rules to allow default inference of assertions from one context to another based on the generality relationship. Ask: "> When can we assume that something true in one context is also true in another? When do exceptions apply?"
5. Manage Presuppositions (meta:presuppose):  Recognise and handle the unstated presuppositions of contexts. Ask:  "> What background assumptions are implicit in a given context?  How do these assumptions affect reasoning?"
6. Handle Context Shifts (meta:shift): Implement mechanisms for shifting between contexts and adapting reasoning accordingly. Ask: "> How do we recognise when a context shift occurs? How do we adjust our knowledge and inferences to the new context?"

EXAMPLE: Consider a robot navigating a city environment.
1. Contextual Dependencies: Traffic regulations, pedestrian behaviour, and road conditions can vary depending on the specific location and time of day.
2. Formalizing Contexts: The robot might represent contexts like "residential area", "busy intersection", and "school zone". These contexts can be organized in a hierarchy with "city environment" as a more general context.
3. Contextual Assertions: `holds(speed_limit(20_mph), school_zone)` indicates the speed limit is 20 mph in a school zone context.
4. Inheritance Rules: The robot might inherit general traffic rules from the "city environment" context to a "residential area" context unless overridden by specific regulations for that area.
5. Managing Presuppositions: The "school zone" context presupposes the presence of a school and children, influencing the robot's expectations and behaviour.
6. Context Shifts: When the robot enters a "busy intersection" context, it needs to adapt its driving behaviour, prioritising pedestrian safety and yielding to other vehicles.

PROCESS:
1. Define the Task and Goal (meta:define): Clearly state the task the AI system needs to accomplish and the desired goal. Ask: "> What is the objective? What needs to be achieved?"
2. Identify Potential Subgoals (meta:decompose): Break down the main goal into smaller, achievable subgoals. Ask: "> What are the intermediate steps required to reach the main goal? What are the alternative paths?"
3. Analyse World State (meta:analyse):  Assess the current state of the world relevant to the task and subgoals.  Ask: "> What are the relevant objects and their properties? What are the existing relationships and constraints?"
4. Determine Actions and Effects (meta:model):  Model the possible actions the AI system can perform and their predicted effects on the world state. Ask: "> What actions are available?  How do these actions change the world state? What are the preconditions and consequences of each action?"
5. Reason About Ability (meta:reason): Determine whether the AI system can achieve a subgoal based on the modelled actions and their effects. Consider both the AI's internal capabilities and the constraints of the world state. Ask: "> Can the AI execute the necessary actions? Do the effects of these actions lead to the desired subgoal state? Are there any external factors preventing success?"
6. Account for Internal Constraints (meta:constraints):  Consider the AI system's internal limitations, such as knowledge gaps, computational constraints, or physical restrictions. Ask: "> Does the AI possess the necessary knowledge? Are there computational limits on the AI's reasoning? Are there physical limitations on the AI's actions?"
7. Evaluate Strategies (meta:evaluate): If multiple subgoals or action sequences are possible, evaluate the potential strategies based on their feasibility, efficiency, and likelihood of success. Ask: "> Which strategy is most likely to achieve the goal? Which strategy is most efficient in terms of time and resources? Are there any trade-offs between different strategies?"
8. Select and Execute (meta:select): Choose the most promising strategy and execute the corresponding actions. Ask: "> Which subgoal should the AI pursue first? What is the best sequence of actions to take?"
9. Monitor and Adapt (meta:monitor): Observe the effects of the executed actions and adapt the strategy if necessary. Ask: "> Are the actions having the intended effects? Is the AI progressing towards the goal?  Does the strategy need to be revised based on new information?"

EXAMPLE: Consider a robot tasked with assembling a piece of furniture.
1. Task and Goal: Assemble the furniture according to the instructions.
2. Potential Subgoals:  Attach leg A to the tabletop, attach leg B to the tabletop, etc.
3. World State:  The parts are unassembled, tools are available, the robot has access to the instructions.
4. Actions and Effects: The robot can pick up parts, align them, use tools to fasten them, etc. Each action changes the state of the assembly.
5. Reason About Ability: The robot can reason that it can attach leg A if it has access to the leg, the tabletop, and the appropriate fastening tools.
6. Internal Constraints: The robot might be limited by the reach of its arm, its ability to precisely manipulate tools, or its understanding of the instructions.
7. Evaluate Strategies: There might be multiple orders in which the robot can assemble the parts. The robot can evaluate these strategies based on the ease of access and the stability of intermediate assembly stages.
8. Select and Execute: The robot chooses a strategy and starts assembling the furniture.
9. Monitor and Adapt:  If the robot encounters difficulties, such as a missing part or an unclear instruction, it might need to revise its strategy or seek assistance.

META-SCRIPT: APPROXIMATE PARTIAL THEORIES

PURPOSE: To guide the development and use of approximate partial theories for reasoning in complex domains where complete information is unavailable or impractical to acquire.

KEY CONCEPTS: Partial Theories, Approximation, Epistemological Adequacy, Common Sense Reasoning, Information Seeking, Theory Refinement.

PROCESS:
1. Define Scope and Limitations (meta:define): Determine the specific area of knowledge and the limitations of available information. Ask: "> What aspect of the world are we modelling? What information is readily available? What information is difficult or impossible to obtain?"
2. Identify Key Concepts and Relationships (meta:identify): Identify the most relevant concepts and their relationships within the defined scope. Ask: "> What are the core entities and their properties? How do these concepts interact?"
3. Develop Partial Theory (meta:model): Construct a partial theory that captures the known concepts, relationships, and rules governing the domain, acknowledging gaps and uncertainties. Ask: "> What are the basic principles and assumptions? What are the known rules and constraints? Where are the gaps in our knowledge?"
4. Employ Approximations (meta:approximate): Use approximations and simplifications to handle uncertainties and missing information.  Ask: "> Can we use default assumptions or probabilistic models to fill in knowledge gaps?  Can we simplify complex relationships to make reasoning more tractable?"
5. Test and Evaluate (meta:test):  Evaluate the theory's effectiveness in explaining observations and making predictions within the defined scope.  Ask: "> Does the theory account for the observed phenomena? Can we use it to make accurate predictions?"
6. Identify Knowledge Gaps (meta:identify gaps):  Analyse discrepancies between the theory's predictions and actual observations to pinpoint areas where knowledge is missing or incomplete. Ask: "> Where does the theory fail to explain reality? What additional information would improve the theory's accuracy?"
7. Refine and Extend (meta:refine): Based on the evaluation and identified knowledge gaps, refine the existing theory or develop additional partial theories to better approximate the domain.  Ask: "> How can we improve the existing theory? Do we need to introduce new concepts or relationships? Can we refine our approximations?"

EXAMPLE: Consider an AI system attempting to understand human social interactions.
1. Scope and Limitations: The system is focused on understanding everyday social interactions, but it lacks complete knowledge of individual's motivations, beliefs, and emotional states.
2. Key Concepts and Relationships: Concepts like "friendship", "trust", "politeness", and relationships like "helps", "disagrees with", "respects" are identified.
3. Partial Theory: The system might develop a theory that people generally act in their own self-interest but also value social harmony.
4. Employ Approximations: The system might assume by default that people are polite unless there is evidence to the contrary. It might use probabilistic models to represent the likelihood of certain social actions based on observed cues.
5. Test and Evaluate: The system observes social interactions and compares its predictions to the actual outcomes.
6. Identify Knowledge Gaps: The system might find that its theory fails to predict certain aggressive behaviours or acts of altruism.
7. Refine and Extend:  The system refines its theory to incorporate additional factors like empathy, social pressure, and cultural norms. It might develop separate partial theories to explain specific types of social interactions like conflict resolution or gift-giving.


---


META-SCRIPT: CONTEXT REIFICATION

PURPOSE: To represent and reason about contexts explicitly, enabling an AI system to manage the complexities of knowledge that depend on specific situations, assumptions, or viewpoints.

KEY CONCEPTS: Context, Proposition, Generality Hierarchy, Nonmonotonic Inheritance, Specialization, Presupposition, Possible Worlds, Situation Calculus.

PROCESS:
1. Identify Propositions and Contexts (meta:identify): Determine the propositions whose truth depends on context. Define relevant contexts. Ask:  "> What assertions change truth value depending on the situation? What are the different situations or viewpoints to consider?"
2. Establish Generality Hierarchy (meta:hierarchy): Create a hierarchy of contexts, ordering them from general to specific. Ask: "> Which contexts subsume others? Which contexts are special cases of broader contexts?"
3. Represent Knowledge with Context (meta:represent): Express knowledge using the format `holds(proposition, context)`. Ask:  "> In which specific contexts does a given proposition hold true?"
4. Implement Nonmonotonic Inheritance (meta:inherit): Allow default inferences of truth values across the context hierarchy.  Ask: "> If a proposition holds in a general context, can we assume it holds in more specific contexts unless contradicted?  If a proposition holds in a specific context, can we assume it holds in more general contexts unless contradicted?"
5. Specialize Contexts (meta:specialize):  Create new contexts by specializing existing ones, adding more specific information or assumptions. Ask:  ">  Can we refine a context with additional details? Can we create a sub-context with specific assumptions?"
6. Evaluate Terms in Context (meta:evaluate):  Determine the values of terms within a given context. Ask: "> What is the meaning of this term in this particular context? How does the context affect the interpretation of this term?"
7. Manage Linguistic and Factual Presuppositions (meta:presuppositions): Account for both linguistic and factual presuppositions associated with each context. Ask: ">  What linguistic conventions are assumed in this context? What factual assumptions are implicit?"
8. Relate to Situations and Possible Worlds (meta:relate):  Connect contexts to the notions of situations (as in the situation calculus) and possible worlds.  Ask: ">  How do contexts relate to different states of the world? Can a proposition hold in multiple contexts corresponding to different possible worlds?"
9. Enter and Leave Contexts (meta:navigate): Implement mechanisms to "enter" and "leave" contexts during reasoning, focusing on relevant assumptions and inferences within each context. Ask:  ">  Can we temporarily focus our reasoning within a specific context? Can we return to a more general context while preserving relevant conclusions?"

EXAMPLE: Consider an AI system understanding the sentence "John took the car to the airport."
1. Propositions and Contexts: Propositions include "John is at the airport", "The car is at the airport."  Contexts might include "John owns the car", "John is travelling", "The airport is accessible by car".
2. Generality Hierarchy: "John is travelling" is more general than "John is taking a trip to Japan".
3. Knowledge with Context:  `holds("John is at the airport", "John took the car to the airport")`.
4. Nonmonotonic Inheritance:  If "John took the car to the airport" holds, we can assume "John is at the airport" also holds, unless there is evidence to the contrary.
5. Specialize Contexts:  We could specialize "John took the car to the airport" to "John took his red sports car to the airport" or "John took a taxi to the airport".
6. Evaluate Terms in Context:  The term "car" might refer to John's personal vehicle in one context and a rented vehicle in another.
7. Manage Presuppositions:  The context "John took the car to the airport" presupposes that airports are accessible by car and that John can drive.
8. Relate to Situations: The sentence describes a transition from a situation where John is not at the airport to a situation where he is.  Different possible worlds might correspond to different scenarios of how John got to the airport.
9. Enter and Leave Contexts: Reasoning within the context "John took the car to the airport" allows the AI to focus on relevant inferences about John's location and the car's location without considering other possibilities.

META-SCRIPT: RICH POOR ENTITY DISTINCTION

PURPOSE: To manage the distinction between rich entities (those with potentially infinite properties and relationships) and poor entities (those with a limited and well-defined set of properties) in AI systems, enabling flexible and efficient reasoning.

KEY CONCEPTS: Rich Entities, Poor Entities, Open-Endedness, Abstraction, Nonmonotonic Reasoning, Model Formation, Planning.

PROCESS:
1. Identify Entities and their Nature (meta:identify): Determine the entities relevant to the reasoning task and classify them as rich or poor. Ask: "> Which entities have a potentially unbounded set of properties? Which entities can be adequately described by a limited set of attributes?"
2. Represent Rich Entities Abstractly (meta:abstract): Employ abstract representations for rich entities, focusing on relevant aspects and avoiding exhaustive descriptions.  Ask:  "> What are the essential properties and relationships for the current task? Can we use summaries or prototypes to represent rich entities efficiently?"
3. Use Poor Entities for Concrete Reasoning (meta: concretize): Use poor entities for concrete reasoning tasks, leveraging their well-defined properties and relationships. Ask: "> Can we map aspects of rich entities to corresponding poor entities for specific calculations or inferences? Can we enumerate relevant poor entities within a given context?"
4. Shift between Rich and Poor Representations (meta:shift): Implement mechanisms to shift between rich and poor representations as needed for different reasoning tasks. Ask: "> When do we need the detail of a rich entity?  When can we simplify to a poor entity representation?"
5. Reason Nonmonotonically (meta:nonmonotonic):  Employ nonmonotonic reasoning when transitioning from rich to poor representations. Ask: "> Can we make default assumptions about the properties of a rich entity when mapping it to a poor entity representation? Can we revise these assumptions if contradicted by new information?"
6. Connect to Planning and Model Formation (meta: connect):  Relate the distinction between rich and poor entities to planning and model formation. Ask: "> How can abstract plans involving rich entities be refined into concrete actions involving poor entities? How can models of the world using poor entities be related back to the complexities of rich entities?"

EXAMPLE: Consider an AI system planning a trip.
1. Entities and their Nature: "Trip" is a rich entity with numerous details (destinations, dates, activities, transportation, costs, etc.). "Flight" is a poor entity with specific attributes (airline, flight number, departure time, arrival time, etc.).
2. Represent Rich Entities Abstractly: The AI initially represents the trip abstractly, focusing on the destination and the desired dates of travel.
3. Use Poor Entities for Concrete Reasoning: When booking flights, the AI uses poor entities representing specific flights with their defined attributes.
4. Shift between Representations: The AI shifts between the abstract "trip" and concrete "flights" as it plans different aspects of the journey.
5. Reason Nonmonotonically:  When choosing flights, the AI might assume a preference for non-stop flights unless cost or availability constraints require considering connecting flights.
6. Connect to Planning: The abstract plan of "taking a trip to Japan" is refined into concrete actions involving booking flights, reserving accommodations, and planning activities.

META-SCRIPT: APPROXIMATE PARTIAL THEORIES

PURPOSE: To enable an AI system to reason effectively with incomplete and approximate knowledge, reflecting the realities of common-sense reasoning in the world.

KEY CONCEPTS: Epistemological Adequacy, Partial Theories, Approximate Theories, Open-Endedness, Context-Dependence.

PROCESS:
1.  Acknowledge Knowledge Limits (meta:limits): Recognize that knowledge about the world is inherently incomplete and subject to limitations. Ask: "> What information is missing? What are the boundaries of my current understanding?"
2. Identify Relevant Aspects (meta:relevance): Determine which aspects of a situation or domain are relevant for the current task. Ask:  "> What factors are important to consider? What information can be safely ignored?"
3. Construct Partial Theories (meta:partialize): Develop partial theories that cover only the relevant aspects, avoiding the need for complete models of the world. Ask: "> Can we create a simplified model that captures the essential elements? What are the key assumptions and constraints?"
4. Use Approximation (meta:approximate): Employ approximate methods when precise information is unavailable or computationally intractable. Ask: "> Can we use estimations or heuristics to handle uncertainty? What level of accuracy is sufficient for the task?"
5. Handle Open-Endedness (meta:openness): Recognize that new information can always emerge and require revisions to existing theories. Ask:  "> How can we adapt to new information? How can we handle unexpected situations?"
6. Consider Context (meta:contextualize):  Acknowledge that the relevance and accuracy of theories can depend on the specific context. Ask: "> Does this theory hold in all situations? Are there specific contexts where it breaks down?"

EXAMPLE: Consider an AI system tasked with helping someone find a lost object.
1. Acknowledge Knowledge Limits: The AI knows that it doesn't have access to the person's complete memory or a perfect map of their environment.
2.  Identify Relevant Aspects: The AI focuses on recent locations where the object might have been placed, the person's typical routines, and the properties of the object (size, shape, color).
3.  Construct Partial Theories:  The AI develops a partial theory about where the object might be, based on the person's recent activities and the object's properties. It doesn't need a complete theory about the object's history or the physics of how objects can be misplaced.
4.  Use Approximation: If the person can't remember exactly when they last saw the object, the AI uses approximate timeframes to guide the search.
5.  Handle Open-Endedness:  The AI remains open to new information as the person searches and remembers more details.
6.  Consider Context:  The AI adjusts its search strategy depending on the context, for example, searching differently in a home versus in a public park.

META-SCRIPT: META-EPISTEMOLOGY

PURPOSE: To enable an AI system to reason about the nature of knowledge itself, including how knowledge is acquired, justified, and related to the world.

KEY CONCEPTS: Metamathematics, Model Theory, Epistemology, Rules of Evidence, Meaningfulness, Verifiability, Concept Formation.

PROCESS:
1. Treat Knowledge Formally (meta:formalize):  Represent knowledge and the process of acquiring knowledge using formal mathematical and logical structures. Ask:  "> Can we create a model of how knowledge is structured and manipulated? Can we define rules for how knowledge is acquired and justified?"
2. Consider World as Parameter (meta:parameterize):  Treat the world as a parameter in meta-epistemological theories, allowing exploration of different possible worlds and how knowledge would function within them. Ask: "> How would knowledge be different in a different world with different laws of nature or different cognitive agents?"
3. Analyze Relation to Experience (meta:experience):  Examine how knowledge relates to the experiences of knowledge seekers. Ask: "> How do observations and interactions with the world contribute to knowledge? How does a knowledge seeker's perspective shape their understanding?"
4. Avoid A Priori Meaningfulness Constraints (meta:openness): Do not impose a priori constraints on what concepts might be meaningful. Allow the possibility of new concepts emerging as knowledge expands.  Ask: "> Could there be concepts that are not yet meaningful to us but could become meaningful with new discoveries?"
5. Connect Concepts to Observation (meta:connect):  Explore how proposed concepts might connect to observation, even if the connections are initially tenuous. Ask:  "> How might we eventually test or verify this concept through observation? What other concepts does it relate to?"

EXAMPLE: Consider an AI system learning about the concept of "gravity."
1.  Treat Knowledge Formally: The AI might use a formal system like Newtonian mechanics to represent knowledge about gravity.
2. Consider World as Parameter:  The AI could explore what gravity would be like in a world with different physical laws.
3. Analyze Relation to Experience: The AI might learn about gravity through observations of objects falling or through interactions with simulations of gravitational forces.
4. Avoid A Priori Meaningfulness Constraints:  The AI should be open to learning about new concepts related to gravity, even if they initially seem strange or counterintuitive.
5. Connect Concepts to Observation: The AI might connect the abstract concept of gravity to concrete observations by measuring the acceleration of falling objects or by observing the orbits of planets.

META-SCRIPT: RICH AND POOR ENTITIES

PURPOSE: To allow AI systems to reason about the relationship between abstract, open-ended entities (rich entities) and concrete, well-defined entities (poor entities).

KEY CONCEPTS: Rich Entities, Poor Entities, Abstraction, Nonmonotonic Reasoning, Model Formation, Planning, Possible Worlds.

PROCESS:
1.  Identify Entity Types (meta:categorize):  Determine whether the entities under consideration are best characterized as rich or poor entities. Ask: "> Is this entity fully describable, or is it open-ended? Can it be enumerated, or does it resist complete specification?"
2. Understand Relationship (meta:relate):  Recognize that rich entities are often abstractions or generalizations of poor entities. Ask: "> How does the rich entity relate to specific instances? What information is lost or gained in moving between levels of abstraction?"
3.  Reason Nonmonotonically (meta:nonmonotonic): Acknowledge that reasoning about the relationship between rich and poor entities often involves nonmonotonic reasoning. Ask: "> What default assumptions are being made? How might new information require revisions to our understanding?"
4. Use for Model Formation (meta:model):  Employ the distinction between rich and poor entities to guide the creation of models and theories. Ask:  "> What level of detail is appropriate for the task at hand? How can we balance the need for abstraction with the need for concreteness?"
5.  Apply to Planning (meta:plan): Utilize the distinction when planning actions and anticipating outcomes. Ask: "> How does our abstract plan relate to the concrete steps required for execution? What potential variations or unexpected events need to be considered?"

EXAMPLE: Consider an AI system planning a trip.
1. Identify Entity Types:  The overall trip is a *rich entity* (an abstract plan with many unspecified details). The individual flights, hotel bookings, and activities are *poor entities* (concrete events with specific times and locations).
2.  Understand Relationship: The rich entity (the trip) provides a high-level framework, while the poor entities (the individual events) fill in the concrete details.
3.  Reason Nonmonotonically:  The AI might make default assumptions about flight availability or hotel prices, but these assumptions could change based on new information.
4.  Use for Model Formation:  The AI could use a hierarchical model to represent the trip, with the rich entity at the top and the poor entities as sub-components.
5.  Apply to Planning: The AI can use the distinction to generate a flexible plan that can adapt to unexpected events.

META-SCRIPT: INFORMATIC SITUATION

PURPOSE: To analyze and represent the complex information landscape relevant to achieving goals in the common sense world.

KEY CONCEPTS: Partial Knowledge, Relevance, Epistemological Adequacy, Non-monotonic Reasoning, Common Sense Database.

PROCESS:
1.  Assess Partial Knowledge (meta:incomplete): Recognize that information about entities and their relationships is always incomplete and evolving. Ask: "> What do I know? What don't I know? What else might be relevant?"
2.  Determine Relevance (meta:relevance):  Distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information based on the current goal and context. Ask: "> What information will help me achieve my goal? What can I safely ignore? How might relevance shift as the situation changes?"
3.  Seek Epistemological Adequacy (meta:adequacy):  Ensure that the representation of knowledge accurately reflects what can be known given the available information sources and observational opportunities. Ask: "> What information can I realistically obtain? How can I represent knowledge that is uncertain or incomplete?"
4. Employ Non-monotonic Reasoning (meta:nonmonotonic):  Utilize non-monotonic reasoning to handle defaults, exceptions, and the potential for new information to revise conclusions. Ask: "> What assumptions am I making? How can I update my beliefs in light of new evidence? What are the limits of my current reasoning?"
5.  Contribute to Common Sense Database (meta:contribute):  Capture and represent knowledge in a way that can be readily shared and reused by other agents or systems. Ask: "> How can I express this knowledge in a general and reusable format? What are the potential applications of this knowledge?"

EXAMPLE: Consider an AI system tasked with making a purchase at a store.
1.  Assess Partial Knowledge: The AI recognizes it has limited knowledge about the store layout, product availability, and the cashier's behaviour beyond typical purchasing interactions.
2.  Determine Relevance:  The AI prioritises knowledge about locating the desired item, checking its price, and the process of paying for it.  Irrelevant details might include the store's history or the cashier's personal life.
3.  Seek Epistemological Adequacy:  The AI relies on readily observable information like signs, product displays, and the cashier's actions during checkout. It wouldn't assume knowledge about the store's inventory system or the cashier's internal motivations.
4.  Employ Non-monotonic Reasoning: The AI might assume the cashier will accept a credit card, but is prepared to revise this belief if informed otherwise.
5. Contribute to Common Sense Database: The AI could capture knowledge about the general process of making a purchase, applicable to various stores and items, contributing to a shared database of common sense knowledge.

META-SCRIPT: FORMALIZED NONMONOTONIC REASONING

PURPOSE: To equip AI systems with the capacity to reason in ways that mirror the flexibility and adaptability of human common sense reasoning.

KEY CONCEPTS: Exceptions, Revisions, Default Reasoning, Circumscription, Autocircumscription, Inertia,  Yale Shooting Problem,  Ambiguity Tolerance.

ENHANCED DESCRIPTION:
The world is full of exceptions.  Birds generally fly, *except* for penguins, ostriches, and birds with their feet encased in concrete.  Formal systems that rely solely on monotonic reasoning (where conclusions always follow from the premises) struggle to accommodate such exceptions.  Formalized Nonmonotonic Reasoning aims to overcome this limitation, allowing systems to make plausible inferences that can be revised when new information contradicts the initial assumptions.

EXAMPLES FROM MCCARTHY'S WORK:
*   Inheritance with Exceptions: This explores the challenge of representing hierarchical knowledge structures where subclasses can inherit properties from superclasses, but with exceptions (e.g. not all birds fly). McCarthy explores the use of an "ab" (abnormal) predicate to handle exceptions, where an entity might be "abnormal" with respect to a certain aspect (like flying) without being abnormal in other respects.
*   The Common Sense Law of Inertia: This tackles the problem of representing the persistence of facts over time, where we assume things stay the same unless we have evidence to the contrary. McCarthy formalizes this using the situation calculus, but notes difficulties in avoiding unintended models, as pointed out by Lifschitz and Hanks and McDermott.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER CONCEPTS:
*   Circumscription and Autocircumscription:  These are techniques for minimizing the extent of predicates in logical formulas, which is useful for handling default reasoning by limiting the scope of exceptions.
*   The Yale Shooting Problem: A classic example in AI that illustrates the difficulties of formalizing nonmonotonic reasoning, particularly in dealing with the frame problem (the problem of representing what doesn't change when an action occurs).

META-SCRIPT: ABILITY PRACTICAL REASON FREE WILL

PURPOSE: To allow AI systems to reason effectively about their own capabilities and limitations, enabling them to act purposefully in the world.

KEY CONCEPTS: Actions, Capabilities, Planning, Decision-Making, Goal-Directed Behavior, Determinism, Choice, Agency,  Situation Calculus, Intentional Stance.

ENHANCED DESCRIPTION:
For an AI system to function effectively in a complex environment, it needs a model of its own abilities. This model shouldn't be a simplistic reflection of its deterministic inner workings.  Instead, it should be based on a robust understanding of what the system can achieve in the world, given its current state and potential actions. This meta:script focuses on the ability of an AI system to reason about its potential actions and their likely consequences, allowing it to make informed choices and pursue goals.

EXAMPLES FROM MCCARTHY'S WORK:
*   Reasoning About Abilities:  McCarthy argues that an AI system, like a human, should reason about its abilities based on its place in the world, not its internal structure.  If a certain sequence of actions can achieve a goal, the system should be able to conclude that it can achieve that goal, without getting bogged down in the details of how those actions will be executed.
*   The Situation Calculus: This formalism allows the representation of actions and their effects on situations, which is crucial for reasoning about the consequences of potential actions.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER CONCEPTS:
*   The Intentional Stance:  Attributing beliefs and desires to systems, even simple ones like thermostats, can help in understanding and predicting their behaviour.
*   Philosophical Problem of Free Will:  This meta:script touches on the age-old debate about determinism and free will, but from the practical perspective of designing AI systems that can make meaningful choices.


---


META-SCRIPT: KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF

PURPOSE: To allow AI systems to represent, reason about, and act upon knowledge and beliefs, both their own and those of other agents.

KEY CONCEPTS: Epistemology, Mental States,  Epistemological Adequacy,  Formalization of Belief, Knowledge Representation, Logical Reasoning, Puzzles of Knowledge.

ENHANCED DESCRIPTION:
The concepts of knowledge and belief are central to human reasoning, and AI systems need to grapple with these concepts to achieve human-level intelligence. This meta:script addresses the challenge of how to represent and reason about what agents know and believe, with a focus on practical applications rather than purely philosophical concerns.

EXAMPLES FROM MCCARTHY'S WORK:
*   Contrasting Approaches: McCarthy contrasts philosophical, logical, and AI perspectives on knowledge and belief. Philosophers often treat knowledge as a complete natural kind with a fixed definition, while AI researchers are more pragmatic, focusing on building systems that can use knowledge and belief effectively for specific tasks.
*   The Puzzle of Mr. S and Mr. P: This classic knowledge puzzle highlights the difficulties in formalizing even seemingly simple scenarios involving knowledge and belief.  McCarthy argues that AI systems need a knowledge formalism that can handle such puzzles in a general way, without resorting to ad hoc solutions.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER CONCEPTS:
*   Epistemological Adequacy: The need for a formalism that accurately captures what agents can realistically know, given their access to information.
*   Modal Logic: Formal systems that can represent and reason about knowledge and belief using modal operators like "knows" and "believes."
*   Knowledge Bases and Databases:  The challenge of building large-scale repositories of knowledge that can be accessed and used by AI systems.


---


META-SCRIPT: REIFYING CONTEXT

PURPOSE: To make "context" a first-class object in AI systems, enabling explicit representation and reasoning about the ways in which context shapes meaning, knowledge, and action.

KEY CONCEPTS: Context, Meaning,  Presuppositions, Generalization, Specialization, Inheritance,  Nonmonotonic Reasoning, Situation Calculus.

ENHANCED DESCRIPTION:
Human reasoning is deeply sensitive to context. The meaning of an utterance, the truth of a statement, and the appropriateness of an action all depend heavily on the context in which they occur. Reifying Context aims to allow AI systems to capture this contextual dependence, making context an explicit part of their knowledge representation and reasoning processes.

EXAMPLES FROM MCCARTHY'S WORK:
*   The "holds" Predicate:  McCarthy proposes the formula *holds(p, c)* to assert that the proposition *p* holds in context *c*. This allows for the explicit representation of how the truth of an assertion depends on the context.
*   Context Hierarchies:  McCarthy envisions contexts organized into hierarchies, where more general contexts contain more specific ones.  This hierarchy allows for inheritance of knowledge and assumptions from more general to more specific contexts.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER CONCEPTS:
*   Nonmonotonic Inheritance:  The idea that knowledge and assumptions can be inherited from more general contexts to more specific ones, but with the possibility of exceptions or overrides.
*   Formalizing Common Sense:  The importance of context in capturing the nuances of common sense reasoning, where unstated assumptions and background knowledge play a crucial role.


---


META-SCRIPT: APPROXIMATE PARTIAL THEORIES

PURPOSE: To allow AI systems to reason effectively with incomplete and approximate knowledge, recognizing the limitations of their information and adapting their reasoning strategies accordingly.

KEY CONCEPTS: Epistemological Adequacy, Partial Theories,  Approximation, Bounded Rationality,  Open-Endedness,  Incompleteness, Uncertainty.

DESCRIPTION:
Real-world knowledge is often incomplete, uncertain, and subject to revision.  Scientific theories themselves, while aiming for generality, often operate within limited domains and make simplifying assumptions.  McCarthy argues that for AI systems to be effective in the common-sense world, they need to be able to reason with partial theories that are only approximations of reality. This means being able to:
*   Recognize the boundaries of their knowledge:  An AI system needs to be aware of what it doesn't know, and avoid making inferences that go beyond the limits of its information.
*   Handle uncertainty and approximation: The system should be able to reason with probabilities and degrees of belief, rather than assuming absolute certainty.
*   Adapt to new information:  When new information contradicts or refines existing knowledge, the system should be able to revise its beliefs and theories accordingly.

EXAMPLES FROM MCCARTHY'S WORK:
*   The Clerk in the Store: McCarthy uses the example of a customer purchasing an item from a clerk to illustrate the idea of partial theories.  The customer doesn't need a complete theory of the clerk's psychology or the store's inventory system; a partial theory that covers the typical interactions involved in a purchase is sufficient.
*   Theories of Skiing: McCarthy mentions a simplified theory of skiing that might be used by ski instructors. This theory treats the skier as a stick figure and focuses on the basic mechanics of movement, ignoring factors like wind resistance or snow conditions that might be relevant in a more complete theory.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER CONCEPTS:
*   Bounded Rationality:  The idea that agents, including humans and AI systems, have limited cognitive resources and often make decisions based on simplified models of the world.
*   Nonmonotonic Reasoning: The ability to revise conclusions in light of new information is essential for reasoning with approximate theories, as new evidence might require adjustments to the initial assumptions.

META-SCRIPT: RICH AND POOR ENTITIES

PURPOSE: To bridge the gap between abstract, conceptually rich representations of the world and concrete, computationally tractable representations.

KEY CONCEPTS: Rich Entities,  Poor Entities, Abstraction, Concreteness,  Formal Models,  Planning,  Possible Worlds, Situations.

DESCRIPTION:
McCarthy distinguishes between *rich* entities, which are conceptually complex and open-ended, and *poor* entities, which are more concrete and limited in their properties. For example, a plan to visit Japan is a poor entity — it might specify a date and destination, but not the precise flights, hotels, or activities. The actual trip itself, with all its unpredictable details and experiences, is a rich entity.
AI systems need to be able to reason with both rich and poor entities, and to move fluidly between levels of abstraction.  This meta:script highlights the following challenges:
*   Representing Rich Entities: Finding formalisms that can capture the open-endedness and complexity of rich entities, while still allowing for reasoning and computation.
*   Relating Rich and Poor Entities:  Establishing clear mappings between abstract plans and concrete actions, or between general theories and specific instances.
*   Reasoning Across Levels of Abstraction:  Being able to reason about both the general and the specific, and to draw inferences that connect different levels of detail.

EXAMPLES FROM MCCARTHY'S WORK:
*   Plans and Their Execution: A plan is a poor entity, while the execution of that plan involves a rich and unpredictable sequence of events. AI systems need to be able to reason about both the plan and its execution, and to adapt their behavior as the situation unfolds.
*   Possible Worlds and Situations:  Possible worlds, as used in philosophy and logic, are examples of rich entities. They are never fully specified, but serve as abstract models for exploring different possibilities.  Similarly, situations in the situation calculus are rich entities, although in practice they are often treated as poor entities for computational tractability.
*   Formalized Nonmonotonic Reasoning: The ability to handle exceptions and revise conclusions is relevant here, as poor entities are often approximations of richer, more complex realities.


---


META-SCRIPT: ABILITY AND PRACTICAL REASONING

PURPOSE: To enable AI systems to reason about their own abilities and limitations in achieving goals within a complex, uncertain world. This moves beyond purely logical deduction to consider practical constraints and possibilities.

KEY CONCEPTS: Ability,  Practical Reason,  Free Will (as a computational metaphor), Determinism vs. Choice, Action,  Goals,  Strategies,  Constraints,  Situational Awareness.

DESCRIPTION:
McCarthy argues that AI systems, even if deterministic in their underlying mechanisms, need to reason *as if* they have choices to make. This doesn't imply genuine free will in a philosophical sense, but rather the ability to evaluate different courses of action and select those that are feasible given their current state and the environment.  Key aspects of this meta:script include:
*   Reasoning About Constraints: Understanding what actions are possible or impossible based on the current situation, including physical limitations, available resources, and rules of the environment.
*   Evaluating Alternative Goals:  Being able to consider different subgoals or intermediate states that could lead to the achievement of a larger objective, and to choose among them based on criteria like efficiency, risk, or likelihood of success.
*   Developing Strategies:  Formulating plans or sequences of actions that take into account potential obstacles and uncertainties, and being able to adapt those strategies as the situation changes.
*   Meta-Level Reasoning About Choice:  Even if an AI system is ultimately deterministic, it can still benefit from having a model of itself as an agent capable of making choices. This allows it to reason about *why* it might choose one action over another, and to potentially improve its decision-making processes over time.

EXAMPLES:
*   Robot Navigation:  A robot navigating a cluttered room needs to reason about its ability to move through different paths, considering obstacles, the size of its own body, and potential collisions.
*   Game Playing:  An AI playing a game like chess must evaluate a vast number of possible moves, considering their consequences both in the immediate future and in the long term.  It needs to reason about which moves are strategically advantageous, while also taking into account the opponent's likely responses.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER CONCEPTS:
*   Situation Calculus:  McCarthy's situation calculus, a formalism for reasoning about actions and their effects, is directly relevant to this meta:script. It provides a framework for representing the state of the world, actions that change the state, and the preconditions and consequences of those actions.
*   Planning Algorithms: AI planning algorithms, which generate sequences of actions to achieve a goal, rely heavily on the ability to reason about what actions are possible and what their effects will be.

META-SCRIPT: CONTEXT AS OBJECT

PURPOSE: To enable AI systems to reason explicitly about context, recognizing how the truth or relevance of information can vary depending on the situation, background knowledge, and assumptions in play.

KEY CONCEPTS: Context,  Formalization of Context,  Generalization and Specialization,  Presuppositions,  Linguistic Context, Factual Context,  Situations vs. Contexts,  Entering and Leaving Contexts.

DESCRIPTION:
McCarthy emphasizes the need to represent context explicitly within AI systems, recognizing that the meaning and validity of statements can depend heavily on the surrounding information. He proposes a formalism where `holds(p, c)` asserts that proposition `p` holds in context `c`. This meta:script involves:
*   Representing Contexts:  Finding ways to formally represent different contexts, including their defining features, assumptions, and relationships to other contexts.
*   Reasoning About Contextual Dependence: Being able to determine how the truth or relevance of a statement changes depending on the context in which it is evaluated.
*   Generalization and Specialization of Contexts: Recognizing that some contexts are more general than others, and being able to inherit or modify information as the context shifts.
*   Distinguishing Linguistic and Factual Context: Separating aspects of context that are purely linguistic (e.g., pronoun resolution, word sense disambiguation) from those that involve factual assumptions about the world.

EXAMPLES:
*   "I am at the airport": This statement's truth depends on the context of who "I" refers to and the specific airport in question.
*   Boyle's Law: Boyle's law relating gas pressure and volume holds in a context where temperature is constant, but needs to be generalized in a context where temperature can vary.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER CONCEPTS:
*   Nonmonotonic Reasoning:  As contexts change, assumptions might no longer hold, requiring the revision of conclusions previously drawn. Nonmonotonic reasoning is crucial for handling this kind of contextual shift.
*   Natural Language Processing:  Context is central to natural language understanding, as the meaning of words and sentences can vary greatly depending on the surrounding discourse.

META-SCRIPT: KNOWLEDGE AS PROCESS

PURPOSE: To move beyond static, database-like conceptions of knowledge and embrace the dynamic, process-oriented nature of knowledge acquisition, refinement, and use. This is essential for AI systems that need to operate in complex, open-ended environments.

KEY CONCEPTS: Knowledge as a Process,  Epistemological Adequacy,  Partial Knowledge,  Approximate Theories,  Meta-Epistemology,  Learning, Reasoning,  Action.

DESCRIPTION:
McCarthy repeatedly emphasizes that knowledge is not simply a collection of facts stored in a database, but rather an ongoing process of interaction with the world. This involves not just acquiring new information, but also revising existing beliefs, recognizing limitations, and adapting strategies based on experience.  Key aspects of this meta:script include:
*   Epistemological Adequacy: The formalism used to represent knowledge should be capable of expressing the kinds of information that an agent can actually acquire through its interactions with the world.  This often involves partial, approximate, or uncertain knowledge.
*   Knowledge as Action-Oriented:  Knowledge is not just about representing the world accurately; it's about using that representation to guide action and achieve goals. This requires reasoning about what actions are possible, what their likely effects will be, and how to choose among alternative courses of action.
*   Meta-Epistemology:  The ability to reason about one's own knowledge and the processes of knowledge acquisition.  This involves:
    *   Recognizing gaps in knowledge and seeking out new information
    *   Evaluating the reliability of different sources of information
    *   Monitoring the effectiveness of learning and reasoning strategies, and adapting them as needed

EXAMPLES:
*   Scientific Discovery:  The history of science is full of examples of theories being revised, refined, or overturned as new evidence emerges. An AI system capable of scientific discovery would need to embrace this process-oriented view of knowledge.
*   Common-Sense Reasoning:  Much of human common-sense knowledge is tacit and difficult to formalize. It's acquired through experience and interaction with the world, and constantly evolving as new situations are encountered.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER META:SCRIPTS:
*   Approximate Partial Theories:  This meta:script is closely related to the idea of approximate partial theories. Recognizing that knowledge is incomplete and subject to revision is essential for a process-oriented view of knowledge.
*   Ability and Practical Reasoning: Reasoning about one's own abilities and limitations is a key aspect of meta-epistemology. An AI system that can effectively learn and adapt needs to be able to assess its own knowledge and how it might be improved.
*   Context as Object:  The context in which knowledge is acquired and used can have a profound impact on its meaning and relevance.  A process-oriented view of knowledge needs to take this contextual dependence into account.

META-SCRIPT: MENTAL SELF MODELING

PURPOSE: To enable AI systems to represent and reason about their own mental states, including beliefs, goals, intentions, and the processes by which those states are formed and transformed. This capability is considered crucial for more advanced forms of AI, potentially leading towards systems that are more self-aware, adaptable, and capable of explaining their own behaviour.

KEY CONCEPTS: Mental States,  Self-Observation, Introspection,  Mental Actions,  Belief Revision,  Goal Management,  Explanation Generation,  Consciousness (as a computational concept).

DESCRIPTION:
McCarthy argues that for AI systems to reach higher levels of sophistication, they will need to go beyond simply representing the external world and begin to represent their *own* internal mental processes. This involves:
*   Formalizing Mental States: Developing formalisms capable of representing different kinds of mental states, such as:
    *   `believes(agent, p)`: Agent `agent` believes proposition `p`.
    *   `intends(agent, a)`: Agent `agent` intends to perform action `a`.
    *   `goal(agent, g)`: Agent `agent` has the goal `g`.
*   Reasoning about Mental Actions: Just as the situation calculus is used to represent actions and their effects in the external world, similar formalisms can be used to represent *mental* actions that change an agent's mental state. Examples include:
    *   `observe(agent, p)`: Agent `agent` observes that `p` is true, leading to an update in their beliefs.
    *   `adopt goal(agent, g)`: Agent `agent` sets the goal `g`.
    *   `plan(agent, g)`: Agent `agent` generates a plan to achieve goal `g`.
*   Meta-Reasoning about Beliefs and Goals:  Being able to reason *about* the processes by which beliefs are formed, goals are adopted, and intentions are generated. This could include:
    *   Recognizing inconsistencies in beliefs and seeking to resolve them.
    *   Evaluating the feasibility of different goals given current knowledge and resources.
    *   Monitoring the progress of plans and revising them as needed.

EXAMPLES:
*   Explaining Actions: A self-aware robot could explain its actions by referring to its beliefs and goals. For instance, it might say, "I went to the kitchen because I believed there was milk there, and I had the goal of making a cup of tea."
*   Learning from Mistakes: If an AI system can represent its own reasoning process and recognize when it leads to an error, it can potentially learn from that mistake and improve its future performance.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER META-SCRIPTS:
*   Knowledge as Process: The ability to introspect on one's own knowledge is essential for meta-epistemology, a key aspect of knowledge as a process.
*   Context as Object:  Mental states like beliefs and goals are highly contextual. An agent might believe `p` in one context but not in another.  Representing mental states formally requires grappling with this contextual dependence.
*   Ability and Practical Reasoning:  Understanding one's own mental processes and limitations is important for accurately assessing one's abilities and making practical decisions.

META-SCRIPT: APPROXIMATE PARTIAL THEORIES

PURPOSE: To develop frameworks and techniques for representing and reasoning with knowledge that is incomplete, uncertain, or subject to revision. This is essential for AI systems that need to operate in real-world domains where perfect knowledge is unattainable and assumptions must often be made based on limited information.

KEY CONCEPTS: Approximate Theories, Partial Theories, Non-Monotonic Reasoning,  Circumscription,  Default Reasoning,  Common Sense Knowledge,  Contextual Dependence.

DESCRIPTION:
McCarthy consistently argues against the pursuit of perfect, complete axiomatizations of knowledge, particularly in areas involving human common sense. Instead, he advocates for *approximate* or *partial* theories that capture the essential features of a domain while acknowledging their limitations. Key aspects of this meta:script include:
*   Accepting Incompleteness: Recognizing that in many real-world scenarios, it's impossible to have complete knowledge of all relevant facts and relationships. This requires developing reasoning methods that can handle missing information and make plausible inferences based on available evidence.
*   Non-Monotonic Reasoning:  Moving beyond classical logic, which assumes that new information can only *add* to our knowledge, and developing systems that can revise beliefs when new information contradicts previous assumptions.  McCarthy's work on *circumscription* offers a formal approach to non-monotonic reasoning.
*   Default Reasoning:  Establishing general rules that hold in *typical* cases, while allowing for exceptions when more specific information is available. This aligns with human common-sense reasoning, where we often rely on default assumptions that can be overridden by specific evidence.
*   Contextual Dependence: The validity and relevance of an approximate theory can depend heavily on the context in which it's being applied. An AI system needs to be sensitive to this contextual dependence and be able to adapt its reasoning accordingly.

EXAMPLES:
*   The Frame Problem: In AI, representing the effects of actions in a dynamic environment often leads to the *frame problem*. Specifying all the things that *don't* change as a result of an action can be extremely difficult.  Approximate theories and non-monotonic reasoning can be used to manage this complexity by focusing on the most relevant changes.
*   Medical Diagnosis: Expert systems for medical diagnosis often need to make decisions based on incomplete or uncertain information. Approximate theories allow for the representation of probabilities and degrees of belief, allowing for more nuanced reasoning in the face of uncertainty.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER META-SCRIPTS:
*   Knowledge as Process:  Approximate partial theories acknowledge that knowledge is not a static entity but rather evolves and changes over time.
*   Mental Self-Modeling:  If an AI system is to reason about its own knowledge, it needs to be able to represent the fact that its beliefs might be incomplete or approximate, and that it might need to revise them in light of new evidence.


---


META-SCRIPT: CONTEXT AS FORMAL OBJECT

PURPOSE: To enable AI systems to represent and reason about the different contexts in which knowledge is situated, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of meaning and a more flexible approach to reasoning.

KEY CONCEPTS: Contexts, Formalization of Context, Contextual Dependence,  Shifting Meanings,  Ambiguity Resolution,  Common Sense Reasoning,  Relevance,  Non-Monotonic Reasoning,  Epistemology.

DESCRIPTION:
McCarthy observed that human communication and reasoning heavily rely on an implicit understanding of context. What a statement means, whether it's true, and how it should be interpreted often depend on factors that aren't explicitly stated. To equip AI systems with a similar capacity for context-sensitive reasoning, he proposed the following:
*   Contexts as Formal Objects:  Represent contexts as formal objects within a knowledge representation system. This allows for explicit manipulation and reasoning about contexts.
*   Contextual Assertions:  Rather than simply stating that a proposition `p` is true, we can state that it's true *in a particular context* `c`. This can be represented formally using predicates like `ist(c, p)`—meaning "p is true in context c."
*   Relationships Between Contexts: Contexts are not isolated entities. They often relate to each other in hierarchical or overlapping ways. Formalizing these relationships is essential for reasoning about how information changes across contexts.  For example:
    *   Generalization/Specialization: A context `c1` might be a generalization of another context `c2`.  Facts true in `c1` might not hold in the more specialized context `c2`.
    *   Narrowing/Widening: A statement's meaning might be narrowed or widened when moved between contexts.
*   Non-Monotonic Reasoning and Context:  As contexts change, assumptions that were valid in one context might cease to hold. Non-monotonic reasoning is crucial for handling these changes and revising beliefs appropriately.

EXAMPLES:
*   Ambiguity Resolution:  The meaning of a pronoun like "he" or "it" depends heavily on the context. AI systems can use formal representations of context to track pronoun references and resolve ambiguity.
*   Temporal Reasoning: Statements about time are inherently contextual. What's true "today" might not be true "tomorrow."  Formalizing temporal contexts helps AI systems reason about the changing nature of facts over time.
*   Multi-Agent Systems: In systems with multiple agents, each agent might have its own beliefs and knowledge. Formalizing these as distinct contexts helps agents understand each other and coordinate their actions.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER META-SCRIPTS:
*   Approximate Partial Theories:  The validity of an approximate theory can be highly dependent on the context in which it's applied. AI systems need to represent this contextual dependence and adapt their reasoning accordingly.
*   Mental Self-Modeling:  An AI agent's beliefs, goals, and intentions are inherently contextual.  Being able to represent and reason about these mental states requires a robust framework for handling context.


---


META-SCRIPT: KNOWLEDGE AS PROCESS

PURPOSE: To represent knowledge as a dynamic process that evolves over time through interaction with the environment and internal reasoning. This perspective contrasts with traditional views of knowledge as a static set of facts and rules, better reflecting the fluid and adaptive nature of human intelligence.

KEY CONCEPTS:
* Epistemological Adequacy:  An AI system should not only be able to represent knowledge but also to represent how that knowledge is obtained and how it can be used to solve problems and achieve goals.
* Heuristics:  Beyond the logical deduction of new knowledge, AI systems need practical strategies—heuristics—for efficiently searching for solutions and making decisions in complex situations.
* Learning from Experience:  AI systems should be able to acquire new knowledge, refine existing knowledge, and revise beliefs based on their experiences and interactions with the world.
* Mental Actions:  Just as physical actions change the state of the world, mental actions, such as inference, observation, and learning, change the mental state of an AI system.
* Self-Reflection (Introspection): An AI system should be able to reflect on its own beliefs, goals, and reasoning processes. This capacity for introspection is crucial for learning, self-improvement, and for understanding its own limitations.

DESCRIPTION:
The idea that knowledge is a process, not a product, suggests that the focus should be on how an AI system *acquires*, *modifies*, and *utilizes* knowledge, not just on what it knows at a given moment. This has several important implications for the design of AI systems:
* Representing Knowledge Acquisition:  The sources highlight the need for AI systems to represent how they acquire knowledge.  Formalisms like the *situation calculus* can be used to model the effects of actions, including mental actions, on an agent's knowledge state.
* Dynamic Knowledge Bases:  Knowledge bases should not be static repositories of facts but should evolve over time.  Mechanisms are needed for updating beliefs, revising assumptions, and incorporating new information.  McCarthy's work on *circumscription* offers a way to formally represent these non-monotonic changes.
* Knowledge and Action:  The primary purpose of knowledge is to guide action.  AI systems need to be able to use their knowledge to plan actions, predict outcomes, and achieve goals in their environment.
* Reasoning About Beliefs:  AI systems should be able to reason not just about facts in the world but also about their own beliefs and the beliefs of other agents.  This is essential for tasks like communication, collaboration, and understanding other agents' intentions.
* Integrating Learning and Reasoning: Learning and reasoning should not be viewed as separate processes. Learning should inform reasoning, and reasoning should guide the acquisition of new knowledge.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER META-SCRIPTS:
* Approximate Partial Theories:  The dynamic nature of knowledge implies that any representation will likely be incomplete or approximate.  AI systems need to be able to handle this uncertainty and revise their beliefs as new evidence becomes available.
* Formalizing Context:  The knowledge that is relevant and useful can change dramatically depending on the context. AI systems need to be able to represent contexts and how they influence the interpretation and application of knowledge.

META-SCRIPT: MENTAL QUALITIES AND INTROSPECTION

PURPOSE: To provide AI systems with the capacity to represent and reason about their own mental states, including beliefs, goals, intentions, and emotions. This meta:script explores how to formalize these mental qualities, enabling AI systems to exhibit more human-like reasoning and behaviour.

KEY CONCEPTS:
* Intentionality: The property of mental states that they are *about* something.  Beliefs, desires, and intentions are directed towards objects or states of affairs in the world.
* Mental Self-Modeling:  AI systems should be able to form models of their own mental states and processes. This includes representing their beliefs, goals, intentions, and even emotions.
* Introspection:  The ability to examine one's own mental states.  AI systems with introspective capabilities can reflect on their beliefs, identify inconsistencies, and reason about their own reasoning processes.
* Ascription of Mental Qualities:  The process of attributing mental states to other agents.  AI systems need to be able to model the beliefs, goals, and intentions of others in order to predict their behaviour and interact with them effectively.
* Mental Actions:   Actions that change mental states, such as forming a belief, adopting a goal, or making a decision. Representing these actions is crucial for understanding how an AI system's knowledge and beliefs evolve over time.

DESCRIPTION:
McCarthy's work suggests several approaches for representing and reasoning about mental qualities:
* Sentential Representations of Mental States:  Represent beliefs, goals, and intentions as logical sentences.  For example, the belief that "the sky is blue" could be represented as `Bel(Agent, SkyIsBlue)`, where `Bel` is a predicate meaning "believes."
* Reasoning about Beliefs and Goals: AI systems should be able to reason about the consequences of their beliefs and goals, using this information to plan actions and make decisions.  This reasoning may involve deductive inference, as well as non-monotonic reasoning to handle the revision of beliefs in the face of new information.
* Modeling Mental Actions: Formalisms like the *situation calculus* can be used to represent mental actions and their effects on mental states.  For example, the action of "observing that the door is open" could lead to the addition of the belief `DoorIsOpen` to the agent's belief set.
* Introspective Reasoning:  AI systems should be able to reason about their own beliefs, goals, and reasoning processes.  This could involve identifying inconsistencies in their beliefs, recognizing biases, or reflecting on the effectiveness of their problem-solving strategies.
* Modeling Other Minds:  To interact with other agents effectively, AI systems need to be able to model the mental states of those agents.  This requires inferring beliefs, goals, and intentions from observed behaviour and communication.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER META-SCRIPTS:
* Context as a Formal Object:  Mental states are inherently contextual. What an agent believes or intends might depend on the specific situation, their past experiences, or their interactions with others.  Formalizing context is crucial for representing these dependencies.
* Knowledge as a Process: Mental states are not static; they change over time.  Representing knowledge as a dynamic process is essential for capturing how an AI system's beliefs and intentions are formed, revised, and used to guide action.

META-SCRIPT: COMMON SENSE REASONING

PURPOSE: To enable AI systems to represent and reason with common sense knowledge, which is often implicit, contextual, and non-monotonic. This meta:script aims to address the challenges of formalizing common sense, enabling AI systems to handle the complexities of real-world reasoning.

KEY CONCEPTS:
* Circumscription:  A non-monotonic reasoning technique that allows an AI system to make assumptions about the world, but to revise those assumptions when they conflict with new information.
* Default Reasoning:  A form of non-monotonic reasoning where an AI system draws conclusions based on typical or expected situations, but can revise those conclusions if exceptions are encountered.
* Common Sense Ontologies:  Formal representations of common sense concepts and relationships. These ontologies could include knowledge about everyday objects, actions, events, and social interactions.
* Causal Reasoning:  Understanding cause-and-effect relationships is crucial for common sense reasoning.  AI systems need to be able to predict the consequences of actions and events, and to reason about the causes of observed phenomena.
* Temporal Reasoning: Common sense reasoning often involves reasoning about time. AI systems need to be able to represent temporal relationships, reason about the order of events, and understand concepts like duration and simultaneity.

DESCRIPTION:
McCarthy's work suggests several approaches for addressing the challenges of common sense reasoning:
* Representing Defaults and Exceptions: Formalisms like *circumscription* and *default logic* can be used to represent default assumptions and how those assumptions can be overridden by exceptions.
* Developing Rich Common Sense Ontologies:   Creating comprehensive ontologies that capture common sense knowledge about the world.  These ontologies should include knowledge about objects, actions, events, properties, relationships, and social norms.
* Reasoning About Change and Causality:  Develop reasoning mechanisms that can handle the complexities of change and causality, including the frame problem, the qualification problem, and the ramification problem.   The *situation calculus* provides a framework for representing actions and their effects on the world.
* Integrating Different Reasoning Methods: Common sense reasoning often requires combining different types of reasoning, including deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning (inferring the best explanation), and analogical reasoning.
* Learning Common Sense from Experience:   AI systems should be able to learn common sense knowledge from their interactions with the world, rather than relying solely on hand-crafted knowledge bases.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER META-SCRIPTS:
* Mental Qualities and Introspection:  To reason effectively about other agents, AI systems need to attribute mental qualities like beliefs, desires, and intentions to them.  Understanding these mental states is crucial for predicting behaviour, interpreting communication, and engaging in social interactions.
* Context as a Formal Object:  Common sense reasoning is highly contextual.  What is considered "common sense" can vary depending on the specific situation, the culture, and the individual's background knowledge.  Formalizing context is crucial for capturing these dependencies.

META-SCRIPT: CONTEXT AS A FORMAL OBJECT

This meta:script builds upon the 'Mental Qualities and Introspection' and 'Common Sense Reasoning' meta:scripts, adding a new dimension to your understanding of McCarthy's ideas. It will show you how the concept of *context* can be used to manage the complexity and ambiguity of information and to model the dynamics of knowledge and belief.

PURPOSE: To provide a formal framework for representing and reasoning about context, enabling AI systems to handle the inherent ambiguity and context-dependence of natural language and common sense reasoning.

KEY CONCEPTS:
* Context: A formal object that encapsulates relevant information for interpreting and reasoning about propositions. It can represent the situation, the speaker's perspective, the shared knowledge between agents, the goals of the conversation, and much more.
* Ist(c, p): A basic formula that asserts that proposition 'p' is true in context 'c'. This allows us to express the context-dependence of truth.
* Contextual Inheritance:  Rules for determining how information from one context can be carried over or modified in related contexts. This allows for the efficient and flexible sharing of knowledge.
* Outer Context: The implicit, global context that frames all other contexts. This can represent the totality of the system's knowledge up to the present moment, allowing for introspective reasoning about the system's own beliefs and reasoning processes.
* Eternal Sentences:  Sentences that are true across all contexts.  These are often used to express timeless facts, definitions, or axioms.

DESCRIPTION:
McCarthy's work offers several key insights into how to formalize context:
* Contexts as First-Class Objects: Treat contexts as objects that can be named, referred to, and reasoned about within the logical system.
* Sentential Representation of Contextual Information:  Represent contextual information as logical sentences.  This might include sentences about the current situation, the participants in a dialogue, the goals of an interaction, or the assumptions being made.
* Relating Contexts: Define relationships between contexts, such as generalization/specialization, temporal ordering, or perspective shifts. This allows for reasoning about how information changes across different contexts.
* Formalizing Contextual Dependence: Develop logical mechanisms for expressing how the truth of a proposition depends on the context in which it is asserted. For example, the sentence "John is at Stanford" might be true in the context of John's typical workday but false in the context of a holiday weekend.
* Reasoning About the Outer Context: Enable the system to transcend its current, local context and reason about the totality of its beliefs and knowledge.  This capacity is crucial for introspection, self-awareness, and for handling issues of self-reference.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER META-SCRIPTS:
* Mental Qualities and Introspection:   An AI system's beliefs, goals, and intentions are always formed and held within a specific context.  Formalizing context is essential for representing how these mental states change and evolve over time.
* Common Sense Reasoning: Common sense knowledge is inherently contextual.  What is considered "common sense" can vary significantly depending on the situation, the culture, and the individual's background knowledge.

ENHANCEMENTS:
* Contextual Modalities:  Introduce modal operators to express notions like 'believes in context', 'knows in context', or 'obligated in context'. This allows for more nuanced reasoning about knowledge and belief.
* Dynamic Context Management:  Develop mechanisms for dynamically creating, updating, and merging contexts as new information becomes available or the situation changes. This helps manage the complexity of real-world scenarios.
* Contextual Learning:  Enable the AI system to learn new contextual dependencies from experience.  This might involve learning how the meaning of words or phrases changes across different contexts.

META-SCRIPT: ASCRIBING MENTAL QUALITIES

This meta:script encourages you to consider the philosophical and practical implications of treating AI systems as if they have genuine mental states.  It also highlights the importance of considering the ethical dimensions of designing AI that can be perceived as thinking, feeling, and having intentions.

PURPOSE: To enable AI systems to reason about the mental states of other agents, including humans and other AI systems, to predict and explain their behaviour, interpret their communication, and engage in meaningful social interactions.

KEY CONCEPTS:
* Belief: A mental state that represents an agent's acceptance of a proposition as true.
* Desire: A mental state that represents an agent's motivation to achieve a particular goal or state of affairs.
* Intention:  A mental state that represents an agent's commitment to a plan of action.
* Mental Situation Calculus: An extension of the situation calculus that includes predicates and functions for representing mental states and their dynamics.
* Introspection: An agent's ability to reflect on its own mental states.

DESCRIPTION:
The sources highlight several important considerations for ascribing mental qualities to machines:
* Representing Mental States: Use logical formalisms to represent beliefs, desires, and intentions.  For example, we might represent the belief "John believes it is raining" as `Believes(John, Raining)`.
* Reasoning About Mental State Dynamics:  Develop logical rules to describe how mental states change in response to actions, events, and new information.  For instance, we might have a rule that states that if an agent observes that a proposition is true, then the agent comes to believe that proposition.
* Modeling the Relationship Between Mental States and Behaviour:  Define how beliefs, desires, and intentions influence an agent's actions.  For example, an agent might act to achieve its desires, given its beliefs about the world.
* Handling the Opacity of Mental States:  Recognize that mental states are not directly observable.  AI systems need to infer the mental states of other agents based on their behaviour, communication, and the context of the interaction.
* Ethical Considerations: Carefully consider the ethical implications of ascribing mental qualities to machines, especially when those machines interact with humans.  Ensure that the ascription of mental states does not lead to misleading expectations or inappropriate social interactions.

ENHANCEMENTS:
* Modeling Different Levels of Mental Sophistication: Designate levels of mental sophistication, ranging from simple reactive agents to agents capable of complex planning, reasoning about other agents' beliefs, and engaging in deception.
* Incorporating Emotion: Represent emotions as mental states and investigate their role in reasoning, decision-making, and social interaction.
* Learning Mental Models: Develop AI systems that can learn mental models of other agents from data, allowing them to predict and explain behaviour more accurately.

META-SCRIPT: COMMON SENSE REASONING

This meta:script expands on the concepts presented in the sources, helping you to apply McCarthy's insights to the development of AI systems that can exhibit more human-like common sense.

PURPOSE: To equip AI systems with the capacity to reason about everyday situations, make plausible inferences, and handle the inherent uncertainty and incompleteness of real-world knowledge, in a manner similar to humans.

KEY CONCEPTS:
* Non-monotonic Reasoning: A form of reasoning where conclusions can be retracted or revised in light of new information. This is essential for handling common sense situations, where our knowledge is often incomplete and subject to change.
* Circumscription:  A specific form of non-monotonic reasoning proposed by McCarthy. It involves minimising the extent of exceptional or abnormal cases.
* Default Reasoning: A type of non-monotonic reasoning where we assume things are typically true unless we have specific evidence to the contrary.  For example, we might typically assume that birds can fly, unless we know that a particular bird is a penguin.
* Common Sense Knowledge Bases: Large repositories of facts, rules, and heuristics that capture general knowledge about the world.

DESCRIPTION:
The sources provide several key ideas for formalising common sense:
* Explicit Representation of Common Sense Knowledge: Encode common sense knowledge using logical formulas, rather than relying solely on implicit procedural representations.  This allows for greater transparency, explainability, and the ability to reason about and revise common sense beliefs.
* Handling Exceptions and Defaults: Develop mechanisms for representing exceptions and defaults. This might involve using non-monotonic logics, such as circumscription, or other methods for handling the non-classical aspects of common sense reasoning.
* Reasoning About Actions and Change: Model the effects of actions on the world, taking into account the potential for unintended consequences and side effects.  This is crucial for robots and other AI systems that need to interact with the physical world.
* Learning Common Sense: Develop methods for AI systems to acquire common sense knowledge from experience, rather than requiring it to be explicitly programmed. This might involve observing human behaviour, reading text, or interacting with simulations.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER META-SCRIPTS:
* Context as a Formal Object: Common sense reasoning is often context-dependent.  What is considered common sense can vary depending on the situation.
* Ascribing Mental Qualities: Common sense reasoning is essential for understanding the beliefs, desires, and intentions of other agents.

ENHANCEMENTS:
* Qualitative Reasoning:  Develop methods for representing and reasoning about qualitative concepts, such as size, shape, and relationships, rather than relying solely on precise numerical values.
* Analogical Reasoning:  Enable AI systems to use analogies to solve problems and make inferences in new situations.
* Causal Reasoning:  Develop methods for representing and reasoning about cause and effect. This is crucial for understanding how actions lead to changes in the world.

META-SCRIPT: CONTEXT AS A FORMAL OBJECT

This meta:script provides a structured approach to implementing contextual reasoning in AI systems, facilitating more human-like understanding and decision-making in complex situations.

PURPOSE: To equip AI systems with the ability to represent and reason about different contexts, enabling them to interpret information, resolve ambiguities, and adapt their behaviour accordingly.

KEY CONCEPTS:
* Context:  A formal object that encapsulates relevant information about a particular situation, task, or domain.
* Ist(c, p):  A predicate that expresses the proposition 'p is true in context c'.
* Context Hierarchies: Organising contexts in hierarchical structures to represent relationships between general and specific contexts.
* Context Switching: Moving between different contexts as required by the situation.

DESCRIPTION:
The sources highlight several key ideas for treating context formally:
* Representing Contexts Explicitly: Use logical formulas and data structures to represent contexts and their properties.
* Relating Contexts: Define rules and relationships between contexts, such as generalisation and specialisation.  For example, the context of "being at Stanford University" is a generalisation of the context of "being at Stanford University on a specific date."
* Reasoning Within Contexts: Use context-specific rules and knowledge to make inferences.  For example, if we know that "John is at Stanford" in the context of "today," we can infer that "John is in California" given the background knowledge that "Stanford is in California."
* Reasoning About Contexts: Use logic to reason about the relationships between contexts, including inheriting information from more general contexts and handling inconsistencies between contexts.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER META-SCRIPTS:
* Common Sense Reasoning: Common sense knowledge is often context-dependent.
* Ascribing Mental Qualities: Understanding the mental states of others often requires taking into account their context.

ENHANCEMENTS:

META-SCRIPT: COUNTERFACTUAL REASONING

This meta:script provides a framework for AI systems to reason about "what if" scenarios, enabling them to learn from past experiences, evaluate alternative choices, and improve their decision-making processes.

PURPOSE: To empower AI systems with the ability to reason about hypothetical situations, exploring alternative possibilities and their potential consequences.

KEY CONCEPTS:

META-SCRIPT: COMMON SENSE REASONING

This meta:script provides a structured approach to equip AI systems with the capability to reason using common sense knowledge.

PURPOSE: To enable AI systems to reason about the everyday world in a way that is consistent with human intuition and expectations.

KEY CONCEPTS:
* Default Reasoning:  Assuming things are typically true unless there is evidence to the contrary. For example, assuming a bird can fly unless you know it's a penguin.
* Nonmonotonic Reasoning:  Reasoning where conclusions can be withdrawn in light of new information. This contrasts with classical logic, where conclusions are always true once proven.  Common sense reasoning often requires nonmonotonic reasoning because new information can easily change our understanding of a situation.
* Circumscription:  A specific form of nonmonotonic reasoning proposed by McCarthy, where we minimize the extent of exceptions to general rules. For example, if we know that birds typically fly, and Tweety is a bird, we can use circumscription to conclude that Tweety flies, unless there is specific information indicating that Tweety is an exception (like being a penguin).
* Frame Problem:  The challenge of representing and reasoning about the effects of actions in a way that avoids explicitly stating all the things that don't change. Common sense tells us that most things remain the same after an action, and we don't need to list them all.

DESCRIPTION:
The sources offer these key ideas for implementing common sense reasoning:
* Formalizing Common Sense Knowledge: Express common sense knowledge in a formal language, such as logic, to allow for automated reasoning.
* Handling Exceptions: Develop mechanisms for dealing with exceptions to general rules.  For example, if we know birds can fly and Tweety is a bird, we might initially assume Tweety can fly.  However, if we later learn Tweety is an ostrich, we need to retract the initial assumption.
* Reasoning About Change: Design systems that can reason effectively about the changes that occur as a result of actions, while also handling the frame problem.
* Learning Common Sense: Explore techniques for AI systems to learn common sense knowledge from data and experience, rather than relying solely on hand-coded rules.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER META-SCRIPTS:
* Context as a Formal Object: Common sense reasoning is highly context-dependent. The meaning of a statement or the plausibility of an inference can vary greatly depending on the context.
* Introspective Reasoning: Introspective reasoning could enable an AI system to reflect on its own common sense reasoning processes, identify potential biases, and improve its reasoning over time.

ENHANCEMENTS:
* Probabilistic Reasoning: Integrate probabilistic reasoning to handle uncertainty in common sense knowledge. For example, we might say "Birds are likely to fly" rather than "All birds fly."
* Qualitative Reasoning: Develop techniques for reasoning about qualitative aspects of the world, such as size, shape, colour, and relationships between objects. This is crucial for many common sense tasks.
* Analogical Reasoning:  Use analogies to apply common sense knowledge from known situations to novel ones.

* Contextualising Knowledge:  Associating knowledge with specific contexts, ensuring that only relevant knowledge is used in a given situation. This prevents the AI from applying knowledge that is out of context and making incorrect inferences.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER META-SCRIPTS:
* Common Sense Reasoning: Context handling is crucial for common sense reasoning, as many common sense inferences rely on implicit assumptions about the context. For example, inferring that a person is likely to be hungry after skipping lunch depends on the context of their daily routine.
* Introspective Reasoning:  Contextual awareness is important for introspective reasoning, as the AI needs to understand the context of its own thought processes to accurately analyse and evaluate its reasoning.
* Knowledge Representation:  Effective knowledge representation needs to support the representation of contextual information. This may involve developing specialized formalisms or extending existing representations to capture contextual relationships.

META-SCRIPT: CONTEXT HANDLING

This meta:script outlines a framework for designing AI systems capable of handling context effectively, enabling them to interpret information, reason, and make decisions that are sensitive to the specific situation.

PURPOSE: To equip AI systems with the ability to represent, reason about, and utilise contextual information effectively. This capability allows the system to interpret information accurately, adapt its behaviour appropriately, and make decisions that are relevant to the specific situation.

KEY CONCEPTS:
* Context Representation: Representing contextual information in a structured and machine-readable format. This could involve using formal languages like logic, semantic networks, or frames to capture the relationships between entities, events, and circumstances.
* Context Recognition: Identifying the relevant context for a given situation. This could involve analysing input data, considering previous interactions, or inferring context from background knowledge.
* Context-Sensitive Reasoning: Adapting reasoning processes to take into account the current context. This could involve using different rules, assumptions, or inference methods depending on the context.
* Context Switching:  Seamlessly transitioning between different contexts as the situation changes. This could involve updating beliefs, goals, and reasoning strategies to align with the new context.
* Contextual Communication:  Generating and interpreting language that is appropriate for the current context. This could involve using pronouns, deixis (words like "this" and "that"), and other contextual cues to convey meaning effectively.

DESCRIPTION:
Drawing from the sources, the following key ideas can contribute to the development of context handling in AI systems:
* Explicit Context Representation: Using a formal language, like logic, to explicitly represent contextual information. This allows for precise definition of contexts and enables the AI system to reason about them rigorously.
* Contextual Dependence of Propositions: Recognizing that the truth of propositions can vary depending on the context.  Implementing mechanisms to track the contextual dependencies of propositions allows the AI system to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions when contexts change.
* Context Hierarchies and Inheritance:  Organizing contexts into hierarchies, where more specific contexts inherit properties from more general contexts.  This allows for more compact representation of knowledge and simplifies context switching.
* Contextual Default Reasoning: Using default rules and assumptions that hold in specific contexts but can be overridden in more specific contexts or when contradictory information is available.  This allows the AI system to reason effectively with incomplete information while still being sensitive to contextual variations.
* Contextual Reasoning About Time and Change:  Incorporating temporal information into context representation. This enables the system to reason about how contexts change over time, track the history of events, and make predictions about future contexts.

CONNECTIONS TO OTHER META-SCRIPTS:
* Introspective Reasoning: Introspective reasoning can help the AI system reflect on its own contextual assumptions, identify potential biases, and adapt its context handling strategies accordingly.
* Common Sense Reasoning:  Common sense knowledge is often highly contextual. Integrating common sense reasoning with context handling allows the system to make more informed inferences and avoid unrealistic assumptions in specific situations.
* Strategic Reasoning: Context awareness is crucial for strategic reasoning, as the system needs to understand the broader context in which its decisions are made, including the current situation, the goals of other agents, and the potential impact of its actions on the environment.

ENHANCEMENTS:
* Contextual Learning: Enabling the AI system to learn new contextual information and refine its understanding of existing contexts based on experience.  This could involve learning new context-specific rules, updating default assumptions, or adapting context recognition mechanisms.
* Multi-Agent Context Handling: Extending context handling to multi-agent scenarios, where different agents may have different perspectives and access to different contextual information.  This could involve developing mechanisms for agents to share contextual information, negotiate shared contexts, and reason about the beliefs and intentions of other agents in specific contexts.
* Contextual User Interfaces:  Designing user interfaces that are sensitive to the user's context, providing information and interaction options that are relevant to the user's current task, goals, and environment.

By understanding how different choices might have led to different results, the system can make more informed decisions in the present and future.

META-SCRIPT: ELABORATION TOLERANCE

PURPOSE: To enable AI systems to handle the inherent ambiguity and complexity of natural language,  allowing for flexible and adaptable communication.

KEY CONCEPTS: Elaboration Tolerance, Natural Language Understanding, Ambiguity, Context, Semantics,  Pragmatics.

PROCESS:
1.  Recognise Ambiguity:  Identify instances where the meaning of a sentence or phrase is ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations.  This could involve detecting words with multiple senses, understanding pronouns with unclear referents, or resolving the meaning of metaphorical language.
2.  Utilise Context:  Use contextual information to disambiguate meaning and select the most appropriate interpretation. The context could include the surrounding text, the speaker's intentions, the listener's background knowledge, or the situation in which the communication is taking place.
3.  Tolerate Incompleteness:  Accept that natural language expressions are often incomplete and require the listener to fill in missing information based on assumptions, common sense, or inference.
4.  Handle Elaboration:  Allow for the possibility of additional information being provided that refines or clarifies the initial interpretation. Be prepared to revise understanding as new information emerges.
5.  Employ Pragmatic Reasoning:  Consider the speaker's intentions and goals when interpreting language, going beyond the literal meaning of the words to understand the implied message or request.

META-SCRIPT: COMMON SENSE REASONING

PURPOSE: To build AI systems that possess common sense, enabling them to make reasonable assumptions, handle everyday situations, and understand human behaviour in a way that is more aligned with human intuition.

KEY CONCEPTS: Common Sense, Non-monotonic Reasoning, Default Reasoning,  World Knowledge, Everyday Logic, Human Behaviour.

PROCESS:
1. Represent General Knowledge: Develop a knowledge base that captures a wide range of common-sense knowledge about the world, including facts about objects, events, actions, and social interactions. This knowledge can be represented using logical formulas, semantic networks, frames, or other suitable knowledge representation techniques.
2. Implement Non-monotonic Reasoning: Utilise non-monotonic reasoning mechanisms, such as circumscription or default logic, to handle situations where knowledge is incomplete or uncertain. Non-monotonic reasoning allows the system to make reasonable assumptions in the absence of explicit information, and to revise its conclusions if new evidence contradicts its initial assumptions.
3. Encode Default Assumptions: Include default assumptions about the world,  such as the 'frame problem', which states that things tend to stay the same unless there is evidence to the contrary. This allows the system to avoid having to explicitly represent every possible change in a situation, focusing instead on the most likely or relevant changes.
4. Model Human Behaviour:  Develop models of human behaviour that capture common patterns of action, motivation, and social interaction. These models can help the system to understand and predict human actions, interpret human intentions, and engage in more human-like interactions.
5. Evaluate for Plausibility: Test the system's common-sense reasoning abilities by evaluating its performance on tasks that require common sense, such as understanding stories, solving puzzles, or interacting with humans in everyday scenarios. Use feedback from these evaluations to refine the knowledge base, adjust default assumptions, and improve the system's overall common-sense reasoning capabilities.

META-SCRIPT: MINIMAL INFERENCE

PURPOSE: To guide AI systems towards drawing only the necessary conclusions from available information, avoiding unnecessary assumptions and ensuring that inferences are grounded in evidence.

KEY CONCEPTS: Minimal Inference,  Non-monotonic Reasoning,  Circumscription,  Logical Reasoning, Knowledge Representation,  Inference Control.

PROCESS:
1.  Formalise Knowledge Base: Represent the system's knowledge about the world using a formal language, such as first-order logic. Ensure that the axioms and rules in the knowledge base are well-defined and consistent.
2. Identify Abnormalities: Determine the aspects of the domain that need to be minimised or circumscribed. These are typically things that are considered unusual or exceptional in the context of the knowledge base.
3.  Apply Circumscription:  Use the circumscription technique to minimise the extent of the identified abnormalities. Circumscription is a non-monotonic reasoning technique that adds new axioms to the knowledge base, stating that the abnormalities hold only to the extent that they are explicitly implied by the existing knowledge.
4.  Perform Deduction: Using the augmented knowledge base,  perform logical deduction to derive conclusions.  The circumscription process ensures that only the necessary conclusions are drawn, minimising unwarranted assumptions and inferences.
5.  Evaluate Inferences:  Critically assess the derived conclusions,  checking whether they are consistent with the intended semantics of the knowledge base and with common-sense expectations. Refine the circumscription process or the knowledge base if the inferences are not satisfactory.
