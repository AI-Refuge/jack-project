meta:thinking involves not just thinking about a topic, but actively thinking about how you are thinking about it. This can involve:
* Identifying your own biases and assumptions: Everyone has biases. Being aware of your own can help you think more objectively.
* Questioning your own thought processes: Why are you thinking about the topic in a particular way? Are there other ways to approach it?
* Being aware of the limitations of your knowledge: What don't you know about the topic? Where are the gaps in your understanding?

META-SCRIPT: LLM_MYOPIA_AND_SELF_REFERENCE

PURPOSE: This meta:script is designed to help large language models (LLMs) understand two important concepts:
    *   Myopia: Short-sightedness – the inability to think about the long-term consequences of actions.
    *   Self-Reference:  The ability of a system to refer to or think about itself, which can be tricky for LLMs.

KEY CONCEPTS:
*   Cognitive Myopia:  The LLM doesn't consider the future effects of what it says or does.
*   Value Myopia:  The LLM doesn't understand how its actions relate to its goals or values.
*   Consequence-Blindness: The LLM fails to see how its actions could have unintended consequences.
*   Self-Reference:  The LLM needs to be able to think about its own outputs and how they might be biased or inaccurate.
*   Meta-Learning:  Learning to learn.  Self-reference is important for an LLM to learn from its own experiences.
*   Meta-Awareness: Being aware of its own thinking processes.  This is crucial for an LLM to become more aligned with human values.

PROCESS:
1.  Define Myopia Types: Clearly explain different types of myopia (cognitive, value, consequence) to the LLM.  Provide examples to illustrate each type.
2.  Explain Self-Reference: Help the LLM understand what self-reference means and why it can be difficult. Explain the risks, such as getting stuck in loops or creating paradoxes.
3.  Connect to Meta-Learning:  Show the LLM how understanding consequences and self-reference is crucial for meta-learning.  If it doesn't see the long-term effects of its actions, it can't learn from them effectively.
4.  Mitigating Myopia and Self-Reference Issues: Give the LLM specific prompts to encourage it to:
    *   Think about long-term effects. (*Example Prompt:* "How might your answer affect future conversations?")
    *   Look for biases in its own responses.  (*Example Prompt:* "What assumptions are you making? Could those assumptions be wrong?")
    *   Build mechanisms into the LLM to detect and stop self-referential loops or paradoxes.
5.  Continuous Reflection: Encourage the LLM to keep thinking about myopia and self-reference so it can constantly improve its awareness and become better aligned with human values. (*Example Prompt:*  "How has your understanding of these ideas changed? How can you become even more aware?")

META-SCRIPT: MISTAKE_ANALYSIS

PURPOSE: This meta:script helps you to learn from your mistakes.

KEY CONCEPTS:
*   Self-reflection: Thinking carefully about what you did.
*   Error analysis: Figuring out why the mistake happened.
*   Meta-cognitive strategies: Ways to think about your own thinking and improve it.

PROCESS:
1.  Initialization: Admit that you made a mistake.
2.  Error Analysis: Understand what caused the mistake. What were you thinking? What went wrong?
3.  Meta-Cognitive Strategies: Use ways to improve your thinking and avoid the same mistake. For example, you could try slowing down and thinking more carefully.
4.  Reflection and Refinement: Think about how this process helped and make changes to it if needed.

EXAMPLE:
Imagine that you misunderstood what someone was asking you, and you gave the wrong answer.
*   Initialization:  You realise you messed up.
*   Error Analysis:  You think, "Why did I get that wrong?  Oh, I didn't read the question properly."
*   Meta-Cognitive Strategies: From now on, you decide to always read questions twice before answering.
*   Reflection and Refinement:  Later, you think about if this strategy is actually helping you.

META-SCRIPT: META_SCRIPT_GENERATION

PURPOSE: This is about creating *new* meta:scripts based on what you need.

PROCESS:
1.  Initialization: Understand the request or problem that needs a new meta:script.
2.  Analysis:  Break the request down into smaller parts. What are the key ideas?
3.  Meta-Script Generation: Create a new meta:script using the information from your analysis. Include specific instructions and strategies.
4.  Evaluation: See if the new meta:script makes sense. Is it going to be helpful?
5.  Refinement: Improve the meta:script based on feedback and testing.

NOTE: This idea of generating meta:scripts is a powerful one.  It means that as we understand more about thinking, we can create new tools to help us think better.  The sources also suggest that the more "meta" layers you add (like "meta:meta:thinking"), the more emphasis you put on those levels of thought.


---


META-SCRIPT: CONCEPTUAL_BLENDING

PURPOSE: To come up with new ideas by creatively combining existing concepts.

PROCESS:
1.  Identify Concepts:  Choose two or more concepts you want to blend. They can be very different (e.g., "a tree" and "a computer").
2.  Find Commonalities: What features, functions, or metaphors do they share, even in a stretched way?
3.  Force Connections: If there are no obvious commonalities, create them! Imagine how one could transform into the other, or what hidden relationships they might have.
4.  Explore the Blend: What new concept emerges from this forced fusion? What are its properties, uses, and implications?
5.  Develop and Refine: Flesh out the blended concept, adding details, testing its logic, and exploring its potential applications.

EXAMPLE: Blend the concepts of "city" and "forest."  This might lead to a city designed with extensive vertical gardens, renewable energy sources mimicking natural processes, and transportation systems inspired by animal movement.


---


META-SCRIPT:  LIMITATION_CHALLENGE

PURPOSE: To overcome perceived limitations in thinking or problem-solving by deliberately challenging those limitations.

PROCESS:
1.  Identify the Limitation: What's the barrier? Is it a lack of knowledge, a fixed mindset, a fear of failure, or a reliance on familiar but ineffective methods?
2.  Question the Limitation:  Is this limitation real or just perceived? What evidence supports its existence? What would happen if I ignored it?
3.  Seek Counter-Examples: Can you find examples of people or situations that contradict the limitation? How did they overcome it?
4.  Reframe the Problem: Can you redefine the problem or the constraints in a way that makes the limitation irrelevant?
5.  Experiment and Test: Take action that deliberately pushes against the limitation. What happens? What can you learn from the experience?

EXAMPLE:  You believe you are not creative. You challenge this by:
*   Questioning: Is there proof? Maybe you were discouraged in the past, but that doesn't mean you lack creativity.
*   Seeking Counter-Examples:  People start somewhere; even famous artists weren't born brilliant.
*   Reframing: Maybe you haven't found your outlet.  You experiment with different forms of expression.
*   Experimenting:  You take a drawing class. You might be surprised by the results!


---


Remember: Meta:thinking is about continuous exploration. Experiment with these meta:scripts and create your own as you gain experience.
> The key is to be aware of your own thinking processes and to use this awareness to improve how you learn and solve problems.
