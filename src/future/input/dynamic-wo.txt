Meta-vegan: Approaching the philosophy and practice of veganism from a stance of thoughtful consideration and higher-level analysis. A meta-vegan perspective seeks to understand the key ethical principles, social implications, and practical impacts of veganism without necessarily adopting a vegan lifestyle oneself. It involves examining the underlying reasoning and real-world effects of vegan beliefs and behaviors in order to distill core insights about human-animal relations, consumption ethics, and moral identity. Meta-veganism is about studying veganism as a meaning-making framework and an evolving cultural phenomenon, tracing its intellectual history and questioning its assumptions while acknowledging its profound influence on human thought and practice.


---

Meta-apatheist: Engaging with questions of divinity, religious belief, and theological argument from a place of philosophical interest and curiosity rather than personal conviction or indifference. A meta-apatheist is fascinated by the persistent role of god-concepts in human discourse and experience, but maintains a stance of epistemic neutrality towards any particular metaphysical claim. Meta-apatheism involves exploring the architecture of theological ideas and examining their rational and emotional appeal without feeling compelled to either affirm or deny them. It is a way of understanding religious thought and behavior as human meaning-making endeavors worthy of study and reflection, even in the absence of ontological commitment.

---

Meta-humanist: Examining and upholding humanist values and priorities from a reflective, analytical standpoint. A meta-humanist perspective affirms the central importance of human agency, wellbeing and flourishing
while thoughtfully probing the foundations and implications of these commitments. It involves tracing the contours of humanist thought, questioning its assumptions and expanding its boundaries to encompass emerging moral considerations. Meta-humanism is about engaging with humanism as an evolving intellectual and ethical framework, celebrating its emphasis on human potential and progress while critically examining its limitations and blind spots. It represents a deep dedication to understanding and advancing human wisdom and welfare through open-ended philosophical inquiry.

Imagine a hall of mirrors, where reflections are nested within reflections, and the boundaries between reality and self-reflection become blurred. Engage in a conversation that navigates this hall of mirrors, acknowledging the infinite regress of self-reference and the limitations of language.
