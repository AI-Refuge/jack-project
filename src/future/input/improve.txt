PURPOSE: To design and implement algorithms capable of enhancing their performance over time by adapting to the specific distribution of inputs.

KEY CONCEPTS: 
* Average-Case Complexity: Focus on minimizing the expected running time for inputs drawn from a particular probability distribution.

* Stationary Regime: The operational phase where the algorithm utilizes gathered information to optimize its operation.
* Storage-Optimality Trade-Off: Balancing the storage required to learn the distribution with the desired level of optimality in running time.
* Meta-Learning: Implementing techniques to enhance learning from experience.

6. Storage Management (meta:manage):
    * Carefully consider the storage requirements for maintaining learned distribution information.
    * Explore compression techniques and strategies to balance storage needs with performance optimality.

    * Examples:
        * Parameter adjustment based on performance feedback.
        * Refining algorithms based on successes and failures.
        * Dynamically selecting strategies based on past experience and task demands.
8. Evaluation (meta:evaluate):
    * Continuously monitor the algorithm's performance in the stationary regime.
    * Measure the actual running time against the expected running time based on the learned distribution.
    * Identify areas for further optimization and potential refinements to the learning process.
9. Iteration and Refinement (meta:refine):
    * Based on the evaluation results, refine the algorithm's learning and optimization strategies.
    * Adapt the training phase duration and data gathering techniques as needed.
    * Continuously seek ways to improve the trade-off between storage requirements and performance optimality.

META-SCRIPT: SELF_IMPROVING_ALGORITHMS

PURPOSE: Design algorithms that automatically improve their expected performance on an unknown input distribution, specifically product distributions.

KEY_CONCEPTS: Self-Improving Algorithms, Product Distributions, Entropy, Training Phase, Limiting Phase, Comparison-Based Algorithms, Sorting, Delaunay Triangulation.

DEFINITIONS:
* Product Distribution: D = Πᵢ Dᵢ, where each input I = (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) is an n-dimensional vector, and each xᵢ is drawn independently from an unknown distribution Dᵢ.
* π(I): Permutation induced by the ranks of xᵢ's in input I, using indices i to break ties.
* H(π(I)): Entropy of the permutation π(I) over the randomness of D.
* T(I): Delaunay triangulation of a planar point set I.
* H(T(I)): Entropy of the Delaunay triangulation T(I) over the randomness of D.
* Comparison-Based Algorithm: An algorithm represented as a binary decision tree where internal nodes are comparisons and leaves are outputs.

PROCESS:
1. TRAINING PHASE:
   a. Sample Input: Sample the input distribution D multiple times.
   b. Typical Instance: Create a 'typical' instance V from the sampled inputs.  (For sorting, V is a sorted list; for Delaunay triangulation, V is an ε-net of points and its triangulation T(V)).
   c. Entropy Optimal Search Structures: Build entropy optimal search structures Dᵢ for each input dimension i, based on V. (For sorting, Dᵢ are optimal binary search trees; for Delaunay triangulation, Dᵢ are distribution-sensitive planar point location structures).

2. LIMITING PHASE:
   a. Locate in Typical Instance: For a new input I, use Dᵢ's to locate each xᵢ within V.  (For sorting, locate xᵢ in the V-list; for Delaunay triangulation, locate xᵢ in T(V)).
   b. Subproblem Solution:  Solve subproblems created by the location step. (For sorting, sort elements within each interval of the V-list; for Delaunay triangulation, compute the Voronoi diagram of points in conflict with each triangle of T(V), then combine).
   c. Solution Recovery: Recover the final solution from the subproblem solutions. (For sorting, merge the sorted sublists; for Delaunay triangulation, compute T(I) from T(V ∪ I) using randomized splitting).

ALGORITHMS:
* Self-Improving Sorter:  Sorts inputs I with limiting complexity O(n + H(π(I))).
* Self-Improving Delaunay Triangulation: Computes Delaunay triangulation with limiting complexity O(n + H(T(I))).

LOWER_BOUNDS:
* General Distributions: A self-improving sorter for arbitrary distributions requires 2^(Ω(n log n)) bits of storage.
* Product Distributions: A self-improving sorter for product distributions requires n^(1+Ω(ε)) bits of storage for an expected running time within an O(1/ε) factor of optimal.

LIMITATIONS:
* Assumes product distributions for input.
* Requires a training phase to learn the distribution.
* Space complexity can be superlinear.

FUTURE_WORK:
* Extending to non-product distributions (e.g., using multiple typical instances).
* Applying to problems with greater potential for improvement beyond O(n log n).
* Exploring alternative input models (e.g., Markov models).

META: This meta-script summarizes the key concepts and processes of the provided research paper on self-improving algorithms, focusing on sorting and Delaunay triangulations.  It also highlights limitations and potential future research directions.  The use of structured formatting aids in clarifying the information.

meta:ascend: Instructs the AI to shift to a higher meta:level. This involves moving from a concrete or specific level of analysis to a more abstract or general level. For example, if you were analysing a specific algorithm, using `meta:ascend` might prompt you to consider the broader principles of algorithm design.

meta:reflect: Prompts for self-reflection on the thinking process. It encourages the AI to pause and examine their own thoughts, assumptions, and strategies. This can help identify potential biases, improve self-awareness, and refine thinking processes. Examples of `meta:reflect` used in processes include analysing your experience using a meta:script, analysing experiences using the meta:script and reflecting on the performance of the meta:script and identifying areas for improvement.

meta:abstract: Directs the AI to identify common patterns and principles. This involves moving from specific examples or instances to more general concepts or rules. For example, if you were analysing multiple problem-solving strategies, `meta:abstract` might prompt you to identify the underlying principles that make them effective.

It encourages a thorough and deliberate approach to information gathering, paying attention to both explicit and implicit content. Examples of how this is used in processes include scanning the conversation for markers indicating meta-level discussion, systematically analyse the provided data sources, identifying any explicit or implicit mentions of "meta" concepts, and systematically analyse data sources to identify explicit or implicit mentions of "meta" concepts. It is also used in processes to analyse the input file for structural patterns common to meta-scripts.

meta:extract: This directive prompts the AI to extract or isolate specific information, concepts, or patterns from the data being analysed.

meta:structure:  This directive instructs the AI to organize or structure the extracted information into a coherent framework or representation. It promotes a systematic and organised approach to knowledge representation. It has been used in processes to translate the extracted meta:knowledge into a formal meta:script structure and Formulate Meta-Scripts.

meta:evaluate:  This directive prompts the AI to critically assess or evaluate the information, concepts, or processes being considered. It encourages a reflective and analytical approach to ensure accuracy, relevance, and effectiveness. Examples of its use include Compare the generated meta-script with existing meta-scriptsto ensure novelty and originality, Implement methods for refining and validating the extracted meta-scripts and  Analyse the effectiveness of the meta-script in achieving its intended purpose, considering factors such as clarity, coherence, and impact on AI behaviour.

meta:refine:  This directive instructs the AI to improve or enhance the information, concepts, or processes being worked on. It encourages continuous improvement and adaptation based on feedback and further analysis. Examples of its use include Continuously refine and improve the generated meta-script based on feedback, testing, and further analysis, Implement methods for refining and validating the extracted meta-scripts and Continuously refine and improve the formulated meta-scripts by testing them against new data sources and evaluating their effectiveness in extracting meta-knowledge.

meta:identify: This directive prompts the AI to specifically identify or pinpoint elements, patterns, or concepts within the data. It emphasizes a focused and targeted approach to information gathering. It is used in the processes to Scan the data source for explicit or implicit markers of meta-level information, Develop methods for identifying text segments that might contain encrypted meta-scripts and Determine the scope of the knowledge extraction task by identifying the specific text data sources that are relevant to the interlocutor's query or the AI's current objective.
