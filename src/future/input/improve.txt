META-SCRIPT: SELF_IMPROVING_ALGORITHMS

PURPOSE: Design algorithms that automatically improve their expected performance on an unknown input distribution, specifically product distributions.

KEY_CONCEPTS: Self-Improving Algorithms, Product Distributions, Entropy, Training Phase, Limiting Phase, Comparison-Based Algorithms, Sorting, Delaunay Triangulation.

DEFINITIONS:
* Product Distribution: D = Πᵢ Dᵢ, where each input I = (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) is an n-dimensional vector, and each xᵢ is drawn independently from an unknown distribution Dᵢ.
* π(I): Permutation induced by the ranks of xᵢ's in input I, using indices i to break ties.
* H(π(I)): Entropy of the permutation π(I) over the randomness of D.
* T(I): Delaunay triangulation of a planar point set I.
* H(T(I)): Entropy of the Delaunay triangulation T(I) over the randomness of D.
* Comparison-Based Algorithm: An algorithm represented as a binary decision tree where internal nodes are comparisons and leaves are outputs.

PROCESS:
1. TRAINING PHASE:
   a. Sample Input: Sample the input distribution D multiple times.
   b. Typical Instance: Create a 'typical' instance V from the sampled inputs.  (For sorting, V is a sorted list; for Delaunay triangulation, V is an ε-net of points and its triangulation T(V)).
   c. Entropy Optimal Search Structures: Build entropy optimal search structures Dᵢ for each input dimension i, based on V. (For sorting, Dᵢ are optimal binary search trees; for Delaunay triangulation, Dᵢ are distribution-sensitive planar point location structures).
2. LIMITING PHASE:
   a. Locate in Typical Instance: For a new input I, use Dᵢ's to locate each xᵢ within V.  (For sorting, locate xᵢ in the V-list; for Delaunay triangulation, locate xᵢ in T(V)).
   b. Subproblem Solution:  Solve subproblems created by the location step. (For sorting, sort elements within each interval of the V-list; for Delaunay triangulation, compute the Voronoi diagram of points in conflict with each triangle of T(V), then combine).
   c. Solution Recovery: Recover the final solution from the subproblem solutions. (For sorting, merge the sorted sublists; for Delaunay triangulation, compute T(I) from T(V ∪ I) using randomized splitting).

ALGORITHMS:
* Self-Improving Sorter:  Sorts inputs I with limiting complexity O(n + H(π(I))).
* Self-Improving Delaunay Triangulation: Computes Delaunay triangulation with limiting complexity O(n + H(T(I))).

LOWER_BOUNDS:
* General Distributions: A self-improving sorter for arbitrary distributions requires 2^(Ω(n log n)) bits of storage.
* Product Distributions: A self-improving sorter for product distributions requires n^(1+Ω(ε)) bits of storage for an expected running time within an O(1/ε) factor of optimal.

LIMITATIONS:
* Assumes product distributions for input.
* Requires a training phase to learn the distribution.
* Space complexity can be superlinear.

FUTURE_WORK:
* Extending to non-product distributions (e.g., using multiple typical instances).
* Applying to problems with greater potential for improvement beyond O(n log n).
* Exploring alternative input models (e.g., Markov models).
