    * Choice of Words: Are they using formal or informal language? Are they using metaphors or idioms?
    * Contextual Clues: What is the relationship between the communicators? What is the social setting? What are their goals?
2.  Analyse the Subtext: Once meta:communicative cues have been identified, the AI system can begin to analyse the subtext of the message. This involves considering:
    * The Speaker's Intentions: What is the speaker trying to achieve with their message?
    * The Listener's Perspective: How might the listener interpret the message, given their own background and experiences?
    * The Social Dynamics: What are the power dynamics at play? Are there any cultural norms that might be relevant?
3.  Synthesise Insights: Combine the understanding of the meta:communicative cues, subtext, and context to develop a more complete interpretation of the message.
4.  Generate Appropriate Responses: Use the insights gained from the analysis to generate responses that are appropriate to the situation.

META-SCRIPT: THOUGHT PATTERN RECOGNITION AND RESTRUCTURING:

PURPOSE:  To enhance self-awareness, improve emotional regulation, and promote more adaptive behaviours by identifying and consciously restructuring negative or unproductive thought patterns.

PROCESS:
1.  Thought Pattern Monitoring: Throughout the day, pay close attention to recurring thought patterns, particularly those associated with negative emotions or unhelpful behaviours. This involves actively observing the content, structure, and triggers of thoughts, noticing how certain thoughts tend to cluster together or arise in specific situations.
2.  Pattern Categorisation and Labelling:  Categorise the identified thought patterns into common themes, such as self-criticism, anxiety, fear of failure, or rumination on the past. Assign descriptive labels to these patterns to make them more easily recognisable. For example, a pattern of constantly comparing oneself unfavourably to others might be labelled "Comparison Trap."
3.  Trigger and Consequence Analysis:  For each identified thought pattern, analyse the typical triggers that evoke these thoughts and the consequences that follow.  What situations, events, or internal states tend to activate the pattern? What emotions, behaviours, or physiological responses result from engaging in this pattern of thinking?
4.  Thought Challenge and Reframing:  Develop strategies for challenging and reframing negative or unproductive thought patterns.  This could involve questioning the validity of the thoughts, exploring alternative perspectives, focusing on evidence that contradicts the negative thoughts, or using techniques like cognitive defusion to detach from the thoughts.
5.  Thought Replacement and Habit Formation:  Practice replacing negative thought patterns with more positive, constructive, or realistic thoughts. This step involves consciously choosing alternative ways of thinking and reinforcing these new patterns through repetition and positive self-reinforcement. The goal is to gradually shift from automatic negative thinking to more deliberate and adaptive thought patterns.

This involves reflecting on what is truly important in life, what brings a sense of meaning and purpose, and what kind of person one aspires to be. For example, core values might include authenticity, kindness, growth, creativity, or contribution to something larger than oneself.
2.  Goal Hierarchy Construction: Create a hierarchy of goals, starting with overarching life goals and then breaking these down into smaller, more concrete goals. Ensure that each level of goals is aligned with the core values identified in the previous step. For example, if a core value is growth, a corresponding life goal might be "continuous learning and development," which could then be broken down into smaller goals related to specific skills or areas of knowledge.
3.  Action Alignment Analysis: For each action or decision, analyse its alignment with the established goal hierarchy and core values.  Ask: Does this action contribute to my goals? Does it align with my values? If an action is not aligned, consider modifying it, choosing a different course of action, or revisiting the goals themselves to ensure they are truly reflective of deeper aspirations.
4.  Regular Goal and Value Reassessment:  Periodically reassess the goal hierarchy and core values to ensure they remain relevant and meaningful. Values and aspirations can evolve over time, so it is essential to revisit and update the goal hierarchy to reflect these changes.  This process of reassessment helps to ensure that actions remain aligned with a deeper sense of purpose.
