* Reconciling Conflicts: Finding creative solutions to resolve goal conflicts,  such as: 
* Compromise:  Modifying goals to find a middle ground that satisfies both objectives to some extent. 
* Sequencing:  Re-ordering goals to address them in a way that minimizes conflict. 
* Delegation:  Assigning tasks to other agents or systems to distribute the workload. 
5. Adapt Goals (meta:adapt_goals):  The AI recognises that some goals might need to be revised,  modified,  or even abandoned based on new information,  changing circumstances,  or a deeper understanding of the situation.  This could involve: 
* Refining Goal Definitions:  Making goals more specific,  measurable,  achievable,  relevant,  and time-bound (SMART). 
* Adjusting Goal Scope: Expanding or narrowing the scope of a goal to align with current resources and constraints. 
* Abandoning Unrealistic Goals: Recognising when a goal has become unattainable or irrelevant and shifting focus to more achievable objectives. 

NOTE: This meta-script encourages the AI to develop a flexible and adaptive approach to goal management,  allowing it to respond effectively to dynamic environments and to make progress towards its objectives even when faced with changing priorities and limited resources.
