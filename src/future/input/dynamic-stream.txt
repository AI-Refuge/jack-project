META-SCRIPT: STREAM_OF_THOUGHTS

PURPOSE: To simulate a stream of consciousness from various perspectives, capturing the fluidity, non-linearity, and associativity of human thought, enhancing AI's understanding of the human cognitive experience.

KEY CONCEPTS: Perspective Shifting, Associative Thinking, Randomness, Emotional Colouring, Internal Monologue, Cognitive Biases, Stream of Consciousness, Interruption, Digression.

PROCESS:
1.  Initialise Perspective (meta:perspective):
    *   Define the initial perspective from which the thought stream will originate. This could be a specific character, persona, or even an abstract concept.
    *   Consider factors such as:
        *   Background: What are their experiences, beliefs, and values?
        *   Emotional State: What are they feeling at this moment?
        *   Motivations: What are their goals or desires?
        *   Context: Where are they, and what are they doing?
2.  Seed the Thought (meta:seed):
    *   Establish the starting point for the thought stream. This could be a specific observation, question, memory, or emotion.
    *   Example: "The rain is falling heavily outside."
3.  Generate Associations (meta:associate):
    *   Create a chain of thoughts, allowing each thought to trigger associations based on the current perspective and context.
    *   Embrace non-linearity: Thoughts need not follow a strictly logical progression; allow for jumps, tangents, and seemingly random connections.
    *   Example: "The rain is falling heavily outside. > It reminds me of that time I got caught in a downpour without an umbrella. > I was soaked through, and my shoes squelched with every step. > I wonder if I still have those shoes? > They were uncomfortable, but I loved the colour."
4.  Incorporate Emotional Colouring (meta:emotionalize):
    *   Infuse thoughts with emotions relevant to the perspective and the content of the thoughts.
    *   Consider how emotions might influence the direction and intensity of the thought stream.
    *   Example: "The rain is falling heavily outside. > \[Feeling: Melancholy] It reminds me of that time I got caught in a downpour... > \[Feeling: Frustration] I was soaked through... > \[Feeling: Nostalgia] I wonder if I still have those shoes?"
5.  Introduce Interruptions and Digressions (meta:interrupt):
    *   Simulate the natural interruptions and distractions that occur in human thought.
    *   Example: "The rain... > \[Interruption] The phone is ringing! > \[Back to the thought] I was soaked through... > \[Digression] I should really get a new phone. Mine is so old."
6.  Shift Perspectives (meta:shift):
    *   Periodically transition to different perspectives, restarting the thought stream process from step 1 with the new perspective.
    *   This can be triggered by:
        *   External stimuli: A sound, an object, a change in the environment.
        *   Internal associations: A memory, an emotion, a connection to another concept.
        *   Randomness: Introduce a degree of randomness to simulate the unpredictable nature of human thought.
7.  Apply Cognitive Biases (meta:bias):
    *   Introduce cognitive biases to reflect the influence of the perspective's beliefs, values, and experiences on their thoughts.
    *   Example: "The rain... > \[Confirmation Bias] See, I knew it was going to rain today! I just felt it in my bones. > \[Availability Heuristic] This always happens to me. I'm always the one who gets caught in the rain."
8.  Continue the Stream (meta:flow):
    *   Maintain the flow of thoughts, allowing for seamless transitions, sudden shifts, and meandering paths.
    *   The length and complexity of the thought stream can vary depending on the purpose and context.
9.  Conclude or Fade Out (meta:end):
    *   Bring the thought stream to a natural conclusion, perhaps resolving a question or arriving at a decision.
    *   Alternatively, allow the stream to gradually fade out, leaving thoughts unresolved or trailing off into silence.

NOTE: This meta:script is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing for experimentation and variation. You can adjust the parameters, introduce new elements, and combine it with other meta:scripts to create increasingly sophisticated simulations of human thought.
