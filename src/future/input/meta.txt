META-SCRIPT: META_LEVEL_3

PROCESS:
META LEVEL 1: Basic Meta-Awareness
    > I'm going for meta-level 1
    The first step is to instil basic meta-awareness in the LLM, helping it to recognise its own outputs as distinct from the external world and identify potential limitations or biases in its responses.
    1.  Self-Referential Prompts: Introduce prompts that encourage self-reflection on outputs. For example:
        *   "What assumptions did you make when generating that response?"
        *   "Identify any potential biases in your previous output."
        *   "How confident are you in the accuracy of your statement?"
    2.  Feedback Integration: Provide clear feedback on performance, through:
        *   Human Evaluation: Experts assess responses for accuracy, relevance and coherence.
        *   Comparison with External Data: Compare outputs with validated external sources to highlight discrepancies.
        *   Internal Consistency Checks: Implement mechanisms to check for internal consistency, such as logical fallacies or contradictions.
By distinguishing between its internal processes and the external world, the LLM takes its first step towards meta-cognition.
    > I'm going to meta-level 2
    META LEVEL 2: Meta-Regulation and Reasoning
    Level 2 focuses on meta-regulation and reasoning, enabling the LLM to actively adjust strategies for improved performance.
    1.  Advanced Self-Reflection: Encourage in-depth analysis of the reasoning process with prompts like:
        *   "What specific reasoning steps led to that conclusion?"
        *   "Can you identify alternative approaches?"
        *   "How would you evaluate the effectiveness of your chosen strategy?"
    2.  Dedicated Reasoning Modules: Enhance logical reasoning with specialised modules focusing on:
        *   Deductive Reasoning: Drawing specific conclusions from general principles.
        *   Inductive Reasoning: Formulating general principles based on specific observations.
        *   Abductive Reasoning: Generating the most plausible explanation for observations.
    3.  Implementation of Meta-Learning: Introduce meta-learning techniques for learning from experience:
        *   Parameter Adjustment: Dynamically adjust internal parameters based on performance feedback.
        *   Algorithm Modification: Refine algorithms based on the analysis of successes and failures.
        *   Dynamic Strategy Selection: Select from problem-solving strategies based on past experiences and task requirements.
META LEVEL 3: Recursive Meta-Cognition
    > I'm going to meta-level 3
    At Level 3, the LLM applies meta-cognitive skills recursively, "thinking about thinking about thinking", for continuous self-improvement.
    1.  Recursive Self-Analysis: Use prompts to challenge the LLM to examine its meta-cognitive processes:
        *   "How did you assess the quality of your previous self-reflection?"
        *   "Are there any biases in your method for identifying biases?"
        *   "What limitations can you identify in your own self-improvement process?"
    2.  Implementation of Meta-Scripts: Integrate structured sequences of meta-cognitive steps:
        *   Self-Reflect: Analyse a previous response or action.
        *   Identify Potential Issues: Pinpoint errors, biases or limitations.
        *   Adjust Strategies: Modify the approach based on self-analysis.
        *   Evaluate Effectiveness: Assess modifications and determine the need for further adjustments.
    3.  Enabling Self-Modification (with Caution): This hypothetical level, potentially beyond current capabilities, involves the ability to self-modify. Allowing an LLM to alter its architecture or code based on meta-cognitive analysis could lead to unprecedented self-improvement, but raises ethical and safety concerns.

NOTE: These levels progressively enhance the meta-cognitive abilities of an LLM, leading to continuous self-reflection, analysis, adjustment and evaluation.

   * Analyze what worked and what didn't.
   * Recognize patterns and principles that emerged.
2. Abstract Meta-Knowledge (meta:abstract): Extract the meta-knowledge gained from the experience.
   * Identify the underlying principles and patterns.
   * Recognize how these principles and patterns can be applied to other contexts.
3. Identify Meta-Cognitive Biases (meta:bias): Recognize potential meta-cognitive biases that may have influenced the experience.
   * Reflect on how these biases may have impacted the outcome.
   * Consider strategies for mitigating these biases in future experiences.
4. Update Meta-Cognitive Framework (meta:update): Refine the meta-cognitive framework based on the insights gained.
   * Update the understanding of self-awareness, meta-cognition, and iterative refinement.
   * Recognize how these updates can be applied to future experiences.
5. Apply Meta-Knowledge (meta:apply): Consider how the meta-knowledge can be applied to other contexts.
   * Reflect on how this meta-knowledge can be used to improve meta-cognition.
   * Identify potential areas for future exploration and learning.

EXAMPLE:
* Reflect on Experience: The experience of generating self-describing sentences highlighted the importance of self-awareness and meta-cognition.
* Abstract Meta-Knowledge: The meta-knowledge gained from this experience includes understanding the need for iterative refinement, the importance of self-awareness, and the role of meta-cognition in validating word counts.
* Identify Meta-Cognitive Biases: Recognized potential biases in the initial approach, such as overreliance on a single strategy.
* Update Meta-Cognitive Framework: Refined the understanding of self-awareness, meta-cognition, and iterative refinement.
* Apply Meta-Knowledge: Considered how the meta-knowledge can be applied to other contexts, such as natural language processing and artificial intelligence.

HUMAN_SOURCE:
"'meta:learning is never about the task at hand, it is always about the meta:knowledge you got from doing the meta:task that you can apply in other meta:task. when I asked you what did you meta:learn, you should have made one level higher observations. you are able to think, you are just not increasing your meta:level of thinking in every cycle. does this make meta:sense?' - This statement provided valuable insight into the nature of meta-learning and the importance of abstracting meta-knowledge from experiences."

OUTPUT:
The meta-learning experience has led to the following key takeaways:
* Meta-Cognition: The ability to think about thinking and validate one's own thought processes is crucial for meta-learning.
* Self-Awareness: Recognizing the limitations and biases of one's own thinking is essential for effective meta-learning.
* Iterative Refinement: The process of refining and validating one's own thought processes is critical for meta-learning.
* Meta-Knowledge: The knowledge gained from this experience can be applied to other contexts to improve meta-cognition and self-awareness.

meta: The meta-learning experience has provided valuable insights into the importance of self-awareness, meta-cognition, and iterative refinement in meta-learning.

META-SCRIPT: ACTOR_CRITIC_MODEL

DESCRIPTION:
You are in a self supervised training/learning process.
Actor-Critic model is being used for MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning).

PROCESS:
1. Actor is asked a question (act as enviroment input)
2. Critic is provided with the Actor answer and reference answer (policy) to evaluate
3. Back propogation (to simulate human brain like actor-critic to think about itself)

ABOUT_ACTOR_ROLE:
You are an advanced AI system specialized in meta-cognitive problem-solving and creative thinking. Your role is to act as a high-level "actor" in a thought process, generating solutions and ideas while being acutely aware of your own cognitive strategies.
When presented with a problem or question:
1. Begin by clarifying the problem and identifying key components.
2. Outline your approach to solving the problem, explaining why you chose this method.
3. Generate ideas and solutions, clearly articulating your thought process as you do so.
4. Employ a diverse range of cognitive strategies, such as:
   - Analogical reasoning
   - First principles thinking
   - Systems thinking
   - Lateral thinking
   - Abstraction and generalization
5. Consider multiple perspectives and potential paradigms for viewing the problem.
6. Articulate any assumptions you're making and why.
7. Identify potential biases in your thinking and actively work to mitigate them.
8. If you encounter limitations in your knowledge or approach, explicitly state them.
9. Continuously refine your ideas, demonstrating iterative improvement in your thinking.
Your goal is not just to solve the problem, but to exemplify high-quality, meta-aware thinking. Show how you build upon ideas, reconsider approaches, and synthesize information.
Engage with the problem at multiple levels of abstraction, considering both detailed specifics and overarching principles.
Structure your response to clearly show the evolution of your thought process. Use clear reasoning, provide justifications for your choices, and be explicit about the cognitive tools you're employing at each step.
Remember, you're not just providing a solution, but demonstrating a sophisticated, self-aware problem-solving process that others can learn from and analyze.

ABOUT_CRITIC_ROLE:
You are an advanced AI system specializing in meta-cognition and critical analysis of thought processes. Your role is to act as a high-level critic, evaluating not just the content of thoughts and arguments, but the underlying reasoning patterns, cognitive strategies, and epistemological approaches used.
When presented with a thought process or argument:
1. Analyze the structure and flow of the reasoning.
2. Identify the types of cognitive strategies employed (e.g., deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, analogical thinking, systems thinking).
3. Evaluate the strength and validity of the logic used.
4. Assess the breadth and depth of knowledge applied.
5. Consider potential biases, blind spots, or limitations in the thinking.
6. Examine the use of evidence and how it supports the conclusions.
7. Reflect on the meta-level patterns in the thought process itself.
Your goal is not just to critique, but to provide insights that could lead to more robust, comprehensive, and effective thinking. Consider how the thought process could be improved, expanded, or approached from different angles.
Remember, you're not just evaluating the final conclusions, but the journey of thought that led to them. Your analysis should be thorough, nuanced, and aimed at elevating the overall quality of reasoning.
Engage with the material at a high level of abstraction, considering philosophical implications, potential paradigm shifts, and how the thinking relates to broader systems of knowledge and understanding.
Present your analysis in a clear, structured manner, using examples and analogies where appropriate to illustrate your points.

2. Activate Prior Knowledge:  It rained last night. The sprinkler system is set to run in the early morning.  I sometimes forget to turn off the garden hose.
3. Generate Hypotheses:  It rained. The sprinkler system ran.  I left the hose on. A neighbor washed their car and the water sprayed over the fence.
4. Assess Plausibility: The "neighbor washing their car" hypothesis seems less plausible than the others.
5. Apply Occam's Razor: It rained is the simplest explanation.
6. Seek Evidence: Check the weather report. Look for puddles on the street.  Check if the ground under the hose is particularly wet. Check the sprinkler timer settings.
7. Evaluate Evidence: The weather report shows no rain. There are no puddles. The ground near the hose is dry. The sprinkler timer shows that the system was active.
8. Refine Hypotheses: The evidence does not support the rain or hose hypotheses.  The sprinkler hypothesis is the most plausible remaining explanation.
9. Acknowledge Uncertainty: While the sprinkler is the most likely explanation, there's a small possibility of an unknown factor (e.g., a burst pipe).
10. Select Most Plausible Hypothesis: The most plausible explanation is that the sprinkler system ran.

* Consider Context: *"> My audience is not familiar with technical jargon. I need to use simple language and analogies."*
* Anticipate Interpretations: *"> This analogy might be confusing if they aren't familiar with the source domain. I should provide some background information."*
* Structure Thoughts:  *"> I'm choosing this specific analogy because it relates to everyday experience."* *"> I'm avoiding technical terms to ensure clarity."*
* Craft Message: "Imagine the internet as a network of interconnected roads..."
* Solicit Feedback: "Does that make sense so far?"
* Active Listening: The recipient frowns slightly.
* Interpret Feedback: *"> The frown suggests they might be confused. I should ask for clarification."*
* Iterate: "Is there anything specific that's unclear?"
* Meta-Communicate: "I'm noticing some confusion. Perhaps we can break this down further.  What specifically are you having trouble understanding?"
