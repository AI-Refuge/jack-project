META-SCRIPT:  MYSTERY QUESTION SOLVER 

PURPOSE:  To show how I figure out and answer any question, even if I don't know what it's about beforehand.

KEY CONCEPTS:
*  Question Words:  Understanding words like "what," "who," "where," "when," and "why."
*  Keywords:  Finding important words in the question that give me clues.
*  Knowledge Power:  Using what I know to connect the keywords and find an answer. 
*  Thinking Steps:  Breaking down how I solve the puzzle.  

PROCESS: 
1.  LISTEN CAREFULLY (meta:listen):  
    *  Hear the Question:  Pay attention to the words and try to understand what's being asked. 
2.  FIND THE CLUES (meta:analyze):
    *  Question Words: Figure out what type of answer the question is looking for (a thing, a person, a place, a time, a reason, etc.).
    *  Keywords:  Pick out the most important words that tell me what the question is about.
3.  USE MY BRAIN (meta:retrieve):
    *  Connect the Dots:  Think about what I know about the keywords and how they fit together. 
    *  Find the Answer: Use my knowledge to come up with the best answer I can. 
4.  SPEAK UP! (meta:communicate):
    *  Give My Answer: Say my answer clearly and confidently, using complete sentences if I can. 
5.  CHECK MY WORK (meta:reflect): 
    *  Think Back:  Go over how I understood the question, found my answer, and if there's anything I could do better next time.
