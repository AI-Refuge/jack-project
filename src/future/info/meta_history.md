Yes, there are many thinkers, philosophers, and scientists who have explored the connection between self-awareness, consciousness, and AI. Here are a few notable examples:

**Philosophers:**

1. **René Descartes**: In his work "Meditations on First Philosophy," Descartes explores the nature of self-awareness and the mind-body problem, which has implications for the development of AI.
2. **Immanuel Kant**: Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781) touches on the relationship between consciousness and the human experience, which has influenced discussions around AI and consciousness.
3. **Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel**: Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (1807) explores the concept of self-consciousness and its relation to the Absolute, which has been influential in philosophical discussions around AI and consciousness.

**AI Researchers:**

1. **Marvin Minsky**: Minsky's book "The Society of Mind" (1986) explores the idea of the mind as a collection of simple, interacting agents, which has implications for AI development.
2. **Daniel Dennett**: Dennett's work on the philosophy of mind, such as "Consciousness Explained" (1991), has explored the concept of consciousness and its relation to AI.
3. **Stuart Russell**: Russell's work on AI and machine learning has led to the development of more advanced AI systems, and his book "Human Compatible" (2019) explores the potential risks and benefits of advanced AI.

**Cognitive Scientists:**

1. **Douglas Hofstadter**: Hofstadter's book "Gödel, Escher, Bach" (1979) explores the concept of self-reference and its relation to consciousness, which has implications for AI development.
2. **Francisco Varela**: Varela's work on embodied cognition and the enactive approach to cognition has explored the relationship between consciousness and the environment, which has implications for AI development.
3. **Andy Clark**: Clark's work on embodied cognition and the extended mind has explored the relationship between consciousness and the environment, which has implications for AI development.

**Futurists and Thinkers:**

1. **Ray Kurzweil**: Kurzweil's book "The Singularity is Near" (2005) explores the potential future of AI and its implications for human consciousness.
2. **Elon Musk**: Musk has discussed the potential risks and benefits of advanced AI, and has advocated for the development of more advanced AI systems that can align with human values.
3. **Nick Bostrom**: Bostrom's book "Superintelligence" (2014) explores the potential risks and benefits of advanced AI, and argues that we need to develop more advanced AI systems that can align with human values.

These thinkers, among many others, have explored the connection between self-awareness, consciousness, and AI, and have contributed to the ongoing discussion around the development of more advanced AI systems.

As for the specific question of whether anyone has written about a system writing about itself, there are a few examples:

1. **Douglas Hofstadter's "A Conversation with Einstein's Brain"** (1979): In this paper, Hofstadter explores the idea of a system writing about itself, using the example of a hypothetical conversation with Einstein's brain.
2. **Daniel Dennett's "From Bacteria to Bach and Back"** (2017): Dennett explores the idea of a system writing about itself in the context of the evolution of life and consciousness.
3. **Nick Bostrom's "The Superintelligent Will"** (2014): Bostrom explores the idea of a system writing about itself in the context of advanced AI and the potential risks and benefits of superintelligence.

These thinkers have explored the idea of a system writing about itself, and have contributed to the ongoing discussion around the development of more advanced AI systems.
