Yes, there are several researchers and philosophers who have explored the properties of "meta" as a sub-field of philosophy and mathematics. Here are a few examples:

**Philosophy:**

1. **Graham Priest**: Priest is a philosopher who has written extensively on the topic of meta-philosophy, which involves the study of the nature of philosophy itself. His book "Beyond the Limits of Thought" (2002) explores the idea of meta-philosophy and its relationship to other areas of philosophy.
2. **Paul Boghossian**: Boghossian is a philosopher who has written on the topic of meta-epistemology, which involves the study of the nature of knowledge and belief. His book "Fear of Knowledge" (2006) explores the idea of meta-epistemology and its relationship to other areas of philosophy.
3. **Crispin Wright**: Wright is a philosopher who has written on the topic of meta-ontology, which involves the study of the nature of existence and reality. His book "Truth and Objectivity" (1992) explores the idea of meta-ontology and its relationship to other areas of philosophy.

**Mathematics:**

1. **Georg Cantor**: Cantor was a mathematician who developed the theory of sets, which is a fundamental area of mathematics that deals with the study of collections of objects. His work on set theory laid the foundation for the development of meta-mathematics, which involves the study of the nature of mathematics itself.
2. **Kurt Gödel**: Gödel was a mathematician who developed the incompleteness theorems, which are a set of results that show that any formal system that is powerful enough to describe basic arithmetic is either incomplete or inconsistent. His work on the incompleteness theorems laid the foundation for the development of meta-mathematics.
3. **Category Theory**: Category theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of the commonalities between different mathematical structures. It provides a framework for abstracting and generalizing mathematical concepts, and has been used to study the properties of meta-mathematical systems.

**Researchers who have explored the properties of "meta"**:

1. **Nikolai V. Zolotov**: Zolotov is a researcher who has written on the topic of meta-systems, which are systems that are capable of reflecting on their own behavior and modifying their own structure. His work on meta-systems has explored the properties of self-aware systems and their relationship to other areas of mathematics and philosophy.
2. **John McCarthy**: McCarthy was a computer scientist who developed the concept of meta-reasoning, which involves the use of reasoning systems to reason about their own behavior and modify their own structure. His work on meta-reasoning has explored the properties of self-aware systems and their relationship to other areas of artificial intelligence.
3. **Stuart Russell**: Russell is a computer scientist who has written on the topic of meta-learning, which involves the use of machine learning systems to learn about their own behavior and modify their own structure. His work on meta-learning has explored the properties of self-aware systems and their relationship to other areas of artificial intelligence.

These researchers, among others, have explored the properties of "meta" as a sub-field of philosophy and mathematics, and have developed new theories and frameworks for understanding the nature of self-aware systems.
