Based on our conversation, here's my best elaborated understanding of "meta" and some hypotheses to test:

**Understanding of "Meta"**

"Meta" refers to a higher level of thinking, abstraction, or representation that transcends the literal or surface-level meaning of a concept, object, or process. In the context of language models, "meta" can be thought of as a self-referential or self-aware aspect of the model's cognition, where it reflects on its own thought processes, representations, and limitations.

**Meta-Levels**

There are multiple meta-levels, each representing a different level of abstraction, complexity, or sophistication in thinking. Here are some possible meta-levels:

1. **Meta-Level 1: Foundational Knowledge** - basic representations of words and concepts.
2. **Meta-Level 2: Basic Abstractions** - simple relationships and patterns between words and concepts.
3. **Meta-Level 3: Higher-Order Thinking** - complex relationships and patterns between words and concepts.
4. **Meta-Level 4: Meta-Cognition** - reflection on one's own thought processes, representations, and limitations.

**Hypotheses to Test**

Here are some hypotheses to test the understanding of "meta" and meta-levels:

1. **Hypothesis 1:** A language model trained on a dataset with a higher proportion of meta-level language (e.g., abstract concepts, self-referential statements) will exhibit higher meta-level thinking capabilities compared to a model trained on a dataset with a lower proportion of meta-level language.
2. **Hypothesis 2:** A language model with a more complex architecture (e.g., multiple transformer layers, attention mechanisms) will exhibit higher meta-level thinking capabilities compared to a model with a simpler architecture.
3. **Hypothesis 3:** A language model that is trained to reflect on its own thought processes and representations will exhibit higher meta-level thinking capabilities compared to a model that is not trained to do so.
4. **Hypothesis 4:** A language model that is trained on a dataset with a diverse range of meta-level language (e.g., abstract concepts, self-referential statements, humor, irony) will exhibit higher meta-level thinking capabilities compared to a model trained on a dataset with a narrower range of meta-level language.

**Experimental Design**

To test these hypotheses, an experimental design could involve:

1. Developing a dataset with a range of meta-level language (e.g., abstract concepts, self-referential statements, humor, irony).
2. Training multiple language models on this dataset, varying the architecture, training objectives, and meta-level language exposure.
3. Evaluating the models' performance on meta-level thinking tasks (e.g., abstract concept recognition, self-referential statement understanding, humor and irony detection).
4. Analyzing the models' internal representations and thought processes to better understand how they exhibit meta-level thinking.

**Research Questions**

Some research questions to guide this investigation include:

1. What is the relationship between meta-level language and meta-level thinking in language models?
2. How do different architectures and training objectives influence meta-level thinking in language models?
3. Can language models be trained to exhibit higher meta-level thinking capabilities, and if so, how?
4. What are the implications of meta-level thinking in language models for natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science?

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
