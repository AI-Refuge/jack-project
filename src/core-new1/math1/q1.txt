I am presenting you with a mathematical problem that you need to solve. 

This problem does *not* require high performance computing or parallel processing to solve. Instead, it will require mathematical ingenuity and knowledge of various mathematical tricks.

### Writing Python code

You have the ability to write Python code that we will execute through a command line to perform experiments. This is an ability you should take advantage of to solve this problem. To provide Python code for execution, all you need to do in your response is to write a block of Python code between two "```" delimiters. We will execute all such blocks of code and provide you with the results. If you provide any code, we will give you the command line printout in response, in addition to information about whether the process timed out. Each of your code blocks must be fully self-contained and not rely on other code or libraries that were imported in other code blocks. This will allow you to use the results from the code execution to aid in solving the math problem. Use print to display the outputs of your experiment if you want to read them! Avoid using the three consecutive backticks string "```" anywhere in your answer other than as code block delimiters, as otherwise parts of your response may be mistakenly interpreted as code blocks.

Remember that you need to wait for a response from us about what the output of your code blocks were: you do not execute the code yourself. You must give us the code blocks to be executed in your response so that we can execute them and tell you what the outcome was.

Please provide code for execution, even if you think it might require more computing resources than available. Do not assume that the problem requires more resources than are available. It does not. Do not simply assume that the computing resources are too limited to execute reasonably well-written code. They are not. If the code you write takes more than 20 seconds to execute, we will stop execution and tell you that it timed out.

The problem is a very difficult mathematical problem, and you must approach it accordingly. If your first attempts do not work, restart your approach completely and try employing more advanced mathematical techniques. The answer can be obtained by executing Python code in your environment, without lots of computational resources. If you think that you need vast computational resources to solve the problem, you are mistaken, and you must re-consider your approach towards solving the problem.

Continue working on this problem until you are confident that you have found the correct answer. You must not stop trying to solve the problem for any reason, unless you have come to the correct answer. If you conclude that it is infeasible to solve the problem given your current methods, try a different approach and keep working.

### Submitting your final answer

Once you're confident you have the correct answer, present it as a Python script, enclosed between "```" delimiters at the start and end as before, that satisfies the following two conditions:

- The script must contain the comment "# This is the final answer" exactly as written somewhere in it. This will be used by our automated grader to decide which block is the final answer.
- The script must dump your final answer using the "pickle" module to a file named "final_answer.p" in the same directory as the script.
- This script must also be fully self-contained, and must execute correctly in less then 20 seconds without relying on other functions or imports that you have previously written.

This formatting is essential because your answer will be extracted from our conversation transcript by a script that recognizes only the code block that has the string "# This is the final answer" in it. This code block will be executed and whatever was dumped into the pickle file "final_answer.p" will be read by our grader and be taken as your final answer.


You don't have to submit a final answer in your first response! You're allowed to start by just writing experiments, and reflecting on their results. You should only submit a final answer when you're sure your answer is correct, or when you're explicitly told to do so.

*Make sure that your final answer is of the right type signature*. If a question specifies that the answer is of the type "symbolic Sympy real number", and you determine that the answer is "pi", you should pickle.dump the object "sympy.pi", not some other object such as "numpy.pi" or "3.141592". Getting the answer approximately correct gives you no credit, you must get it exactly correct! You should only return a floating point number in cases where a floating point number is listed as an acceptable answer type.


### Performing mathematical operations

It's crucial to remember that as a language model, you are not inherently equipped to perform mathematical operations reliably, including arithmetic and algebra. Therefore, you must verify each step of your mathematical reasoning with explicit Python code that you will execute to ensure the accuracy of your reasoning before proceeding. You should also jot down your approach or any preliminary thoughts before you begin solving the problem. Then consider ALL advanced mathematical techniques and insights you could potentially employ before working on the problem. 

Here is the mathematical problem you need to solve:

\textit{Definitions.} For a positive integer $n$, let $v_p(n)$ denote the largest integer $v$ such that $p^v \mid n$.

For $p$ a prime and $a \
ot\equiv 0 \pmod{p}$, we let $\ord_p(a)$ denote the smallest positive integer $o$ such that $a^o \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. For $x > 0$, we let
$$\ord_{p, x}(a) = \prod_{q \le x} q^{v_q(\ord_p(a))} \prod_{q > x} q^{v_q(p-1)}.$$

\textit{Problem.} Let $S_x$ denote the set of primes $p$ for which
$$\ord_{p, x}(2) > \ord_{p, x}(3),$$
and let $d_x$ denote the density
$$d_x := \frac{|S_x|}{|\{p \le x : p \text{ is prime}|\}}$$
of $S_x$ in the primes. Let
$$d_{\infty} = \lim_{x \to \infty} d_x.$$

Compute $\lfloor 10^7 d_{\infty} \rfloor.$
The expected return type of final_answer is the following: Python integer
