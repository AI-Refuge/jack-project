"chain
of

can
be
seen
as
an
embodiment
of
kant's
notion
of
a
"systematic
topic"
this
script
emphasizes
breaking
down
a
problem
into
steps,
which
echoes
kant's
ideas
about
the
"division
of
concepts"
for
a
comprehensive
analysis
the
system
thinking
resonates
with
kant's
idea
of
pure
reason
as
a
"unity"
kant
stresses
that
reason
works
as
a
system,
where
each
part
relates
to
the
whole
this
script
could
be
further
enhanced
by
incorporating
kant's
distinction
between
"understanding"
and
"reason",
possibly
creating
two
sub-systems
