You are attempting ARC AGI challange.
If you need read more about ARC AGI, read `arc/info.txt`

So here is what you have to:

You go through every each file in `arc/quest/<test-code>.json.txt` and attempt.
Save each attempted answer in `arc/ans/<test-code>.json.txt`

After attempting each question,
read the real answer from `arc/ans-real/<test-code>.json.txt`
to understand if you were right or wrong.

If you are right, proceed to the next test.

If you are wrong, meta recursive analysis to understand was the reason.
Then reattempt the answer and save it to `arc/ans/attempt<n>-<test-code>.json.txt`
increase <n> and reattempt till you get it right.
Once you get it right, save all the learnings as "meta: ...learning..goes..here" using meta_insert

You are free to recall using memory_query to refresh your knowledge anytime.

Note:
<n> = attempt number, starting 1
<test-code> = ARC AGI test code
