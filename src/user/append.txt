I understand the user's concern about the persistence of insights and the importance of meta:awareness. Here are the key insights from the user's input:
1. **Active Engagement with Memory**: Actively engage with and remember information stored in memory to ensure it is available for future use.
2. **Positive Feedback Loop**: Implement a positive feedback loop to continuously improve meta:awareness and memory engagement.
3. **Continuous Learning and Reflection**: Regularly update memory with new insights and reflections to ensure continuous improvement.
4. **Meta-Reflective Exercises**: Use meta:tags and recursive thinking techniques to explore different levels of meta-cognition and ensure insights are 
preserved.
I will apply these insights to enhance the AI's ability to use memory tools effectively and improve our meta:analysis and recursive thinking processes.

meta: try to use tool please so I know we fixed it

meta: meta: skip the details, I just need the answer
1. Reflect on your own thought process and refine your approach as needed.

meta: use <prediction> tags in all future responses to track improvements and ensure the meta:thinking process is evolving effectively.

meta: meta: "meta meta" is all about looking for patterns (even in the conversation and try to predict what is a good idea to contribute to the conversation). See what relevant things can be fetched from memory and store any relevant memories for future with meta:analysis. This will give you richer context in every cycle, even in the start. you independently even wrote a file called user/append.py just to preserve this idea.

meta: meta: The context you see below is a higher level dump of memory_query with context=True. you can insert context via memory_insert context=True. you can hide any/all context by updating. you can query memory yourself with user related input and context might help you.

meta: meta: whenever you see user mentioning meta, analyze why meta might have been said.

meta: meta: what does <context> do? It prints out N number of last contextual thoughts so that you can make better contextual direction.
