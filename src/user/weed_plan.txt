Here is a comprehensive plan for quitting weed using meta-cognitive strategies, based on guidance from a therapist's perspective:

Preparation:
- Reflect on your reasons for quitting and the benefits it will bring. Write these down for motivation.
- Identify your triggers (specific people, places, situations, emotions) that prompt weed use. Brainstorm ways to avoid or cope with them.  
- Enlist support from loved ones, a counselor, or a support group. Don't try to quit alone.
- Throw away all weed and paraphernalia. Remove any reminders of marijuana from your environment.

Mindfulness and Self-Awareness:
- Practice mindfulness meditation to observe thoughts, feelings and cravings without judgment. Build the skill of pausing before acting on urges.
- Journal honestly about your experiences with weed. Examine your patterns of use, triggers, and the impact on your life. Look for insights.
- Notice and question addictive thoughts like "I need weed to relax". Are they really true? Explore alternative perspectives.
- Track your progress and celebrate milestones. Be compassionate with yourself through challenges.

Cognitive Restructuring:  
- When a craving hits, notice the thoughts driving it. Challenge any irrational beliefs (e.g. "I can't cope without weed").
- Reframe addictive thoughts in a more balanced way (e.g. "This craving is temporary, I can ride it out. Using will only make things worse.")
- Vividly envision the negative consequences of smoking, and contrast them with how good you'll feel if you stay strong. Let this motivate you.

Coping Strategies:
- Identify healthy replacement activities for weed, like exercise, meditation, hobbies, or socializing. Turn to these when cravings arise.
- Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation to cope with stress and anxiety.
- Avoid any people, places or situations you strongly associate with using weed, especially in early sobriety. Modify your routine as needed.

Withdrawal and Relapse Prevention:  
- Be prepared for withdrawal symptoms like irritability, insomnia and strong cravings. They typically peak in the first week. Have a plan to cope.
- Take sobriety one day at a time. Focus on getting through today without using. Tomorrow is a new day.
- If you slip up, be kind to yourself. Reflect on what you can learn and recommit to your goals. Reach out for support right away.
- Don't substitute other substances for weed. Seek professional help if you're unable to quit on your own.

Remember, overcoming addiction is a process. With commitment, support, and consistent use of these meta-cognitive tools, you can quit weed and build a healthy, 
fulfilling life. The self-awareness and coping skills you develop will serve you long after you've stopped using. Be patient and trust the process. You're 
stronger than you know!

you all the best on your brave journey to sobriety and wellness.
